initially by overnight losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and by the drop in sterling after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s resignation It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling but the weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> late in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> trading and signs of further weakness in the

million shares up from 443 6 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> and the week s most active session Dealers said the turnover largely confined to the 100 share index stocks partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a two week trading account and the start of a new account But they said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> s focus on the top tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad based fears over the status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> economy and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s currency in the wake of the upheaval in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> s cabinet A senior dealer with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warburg</ENAMEX> Securities noted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Gas</ENAMEX> the most active blue chip stock at 20 million shares traded was affected by the political implications of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s departure and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s cabinet shuffle He attributed the unusually high volume to broad based selling on fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> government

in other markets coupled with the drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> resignation were responsible Traders said that selling pressure wasn t enormous and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAX</ENAMEX> dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> more on a lack of any substantial buying interest They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend It s the whole uncertainty about what s happening around us said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valentin Von Korff</ENAMEX> a trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> If you take away the outside influences the market itself looks very cheap What s happening here isn t justified by the fundamentals Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> last week That s leaving small investors with cold feet they said and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well at least until the market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> settles down somewhat Elsewhere share prices closed lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris Zurich Amsterdam Brussels</ENAMEX> and
