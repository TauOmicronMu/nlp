A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved major portions of a package for more than 500 million in economic aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> that relies heavily on 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Development</ENAMEX> appropriators approved 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overseas Private Investment Corp</ENAMEX> are increased by 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> package The conference approved at least 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration The agreement on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and is sharply confined under this year s budget These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> package and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> To accommodate the additional cash assistance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> last week was required to reallocate an estimated 140 million from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively The action on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> came as the conference separately approved 220 million for international population planning activities an 11 increase over fiscal 1989 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> are divided over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Nations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population Fund</ENAMEX> will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant In a second area of common concern the world environment an additional 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> s quota of exports to the profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> market <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> was stripped of this right because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> differences with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> regime but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30 537 metric tons over a 21 month period ending Sept 30 1990 About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated according to the industry but the remaining 23 403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate The potential sales are nearly 9 3 million and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Majority Whip William Gray D Pa</ENAMEX> began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English speaking countries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbados Rep Jerry Lewis</ENAMEX> a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Californian</ENAMEX> added a provision of his own intended to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bolivia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> then broadened the list further by including all countries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S Caribbean Basin</ENAMEX> initiate as well as the Philippines backed by the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii Democrat Sen Daniel Inouye Jamaica</ENAMEX> wary of upsetting its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean Basin</ENAMEX> allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gray</ENAMEX> but the greater question is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Inouye</ENAMEX> who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to insert a claim by the Philippines In separate floor action the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to 3 18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti drug programs in fiscal 1990 The funding is attached to an estimated 27 1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> domestic airline flights The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> but in recent days the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> has been as likely to bounce bills back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> The most recent example was a nearly 17 3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> departments And after losing a battle Tuesday night with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference
