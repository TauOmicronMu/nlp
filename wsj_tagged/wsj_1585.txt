As the sponsor of the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act which would repeal the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> earnings limit for people aged 65 and older I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression era fossil For every dollar earned over 8 880 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> recipients lose 50 cents of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits it s like a 50 marginal tax But the compounded effects of seniors only taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage largely due to the earnings limit she would have to earn an additional 4 930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of 496 Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repeal</ENAMEX> would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefit payments We now need support from the Democrats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rules Committee</ENAMEX> in order to include earnings limit reform in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reconciliation Bill</ENAMEX> Since all four Republicans on the committee are co sponsors of my bill it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor The time is now to lift the burdensome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> earnings limit from the backs of our nation s seniors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep J Dennis Hastert R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Ill</ENAMEX>
