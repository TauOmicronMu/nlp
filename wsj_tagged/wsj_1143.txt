Probably the most clear cut Soviet violation for example is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> radar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arms Control Reality Nov</ENAMEX> 20 1984 the first of some 20 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> editorials saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty Whether the installation is for early warning or space track it clearly is not deployed the lawmakers said Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty at this time The delegation included a reporter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> aides to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Edward M Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Les Aucoin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> staff members The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Post Sept</ENAMEX> 9 1987 The U S S R has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness by giving American representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> radar as well as radar vans in the areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gomel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty of 1972 on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union Letter</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> to U N Secretary General Perez de Cuellar reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tass June</ENAMEX> 10 1988 The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted I say it directly a clear violation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ABM Eduard Shevardnadze Oct</ENAMEX> 23 1989 We re happy we guess to receive confirmation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> violation from the Soviets five years after we started writing about it Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede Without question something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> As it bids for new agreements new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem So after 70 years it is confessing the obvious hoping to be believed about other things It s not enough If the Soviets want to be believed they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious Our own test of glasnost s authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S Soviet</ENAMEX> relations the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> s recently issued Soviet Military Power though in general adopting a softer line repeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> assessment It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX> An explosion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbiology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virology Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> did not address this topic before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> s official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat We doubt this claim just as we doubted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> s assurance last year that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> didn t violate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABM</ENAMEX> treaty And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms control advocates who visited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted meat theory by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> last year The Soviets explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Meselson</ENAMEX> who we read has sold something called the scientific community on the notion that yellow rain attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees found the Soviet anthrax scenario completely plausible We don t believe it And we certainly do not believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> take their word for it <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms control process itself The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> government s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> complaint as with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> is no mere political posturing Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> government But the stated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> position is detailed and specific and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sverdlovsk</ENAMEX> violated the 1972 agreement or alternatively that would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident Until that happens glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> was bidding for with his confessions on <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Monday</ENAMEX>
