<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab Scania AB</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX> broke off talks about a possible alliance after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials concluded that the cost to modernize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> s car operations would outweigh the likely return With the collapse of the talks <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> European analysts expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> which is scrambling to fend off a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> s archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">General</ENAMEX> Motors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp Saab</ENAMEX> meanwhile is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> said last week it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers Among the possible suitors is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S</ENAMEX> p A analysts said last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long term business sense to both parties Individuals close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> side of the negotiations said late last week that the No 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker s automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> luxury car markets In addition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently didn t go far Some European analysts speculated that officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> s highly profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scania</ENAMEX> truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials became convinced they couldn t expect to recover the investment it would require to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> s cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> s problems were underscored <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> when the company announced that its car division had a 1 2 billion kronor 186 1 million loss during the first eight months of this year slightly worse than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab Scania</ENAMEX> had forecast in its first half report last month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overall Saab Scania</ENAMEX> s pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48 9 to 1 billion Swedish kronor 155 1 million from 1 96 billion kronor 303 9 million a year earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry</ENAMEX> analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> said the most likely suitor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> now is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat Saab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> have worked together in the past in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> s 9000 model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Croma</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lancia</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thema</ENAMEX> Last month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab Scania Chief Executive Georg Karnsund</ENAMEX> said his company has had talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> about a broader alliance But the talks yielded nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it he said As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> analysts expect the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> play will allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> for a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> The failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> talks makes it even more crucial for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to be victorious in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> contest said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Reitman</ENAMEX> European auto industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UBS Phillips Drew</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London Ford</ENAMEX> faces an uphill fight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> however <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> wrapped up by the end of the month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> meanwhile is hosting a delegation of members of the British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> who are touring the auto maker s headquarter operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detroit A GM</ENAMEX> spokesman said the visit isn t connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> situation But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> clearly views <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> as a prize worth fighting for since the company s gilded brand image would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four year old effort to market its German built Scorpio sedan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> as a luxury import under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> brand name So despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM Jaguar</ENAMEX> romance analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> by last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> had boosted its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> holding to about 11 of the luxury auto maker s shares outstanding from 10 4 early last week About 5 4 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares changed hands in active trading on <ENAMEX
