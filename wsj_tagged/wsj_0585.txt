Market makers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over the counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading Their motivation however has a strong practical aspect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program</ENAMEX> trading is hazardous to their paychecks The most controversial form of program trading stock index arbitrage is making it tough for traders to make money declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Antolini</ENAMEX> head of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Stock</ENAMEX> index arbitrage the computer guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard Poor s 500 stock index The S P 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies The portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> volume attributable to program trading isn t known as it is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> where it amounted to more than 13 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> Estimates from traders put it at less than 5 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> s average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares Other market maker gripes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program</ENAMEX> trading also causes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Composite Index</ENAMEX> to lose ground against other segments of the stock market Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> stocks without sharp price moves a condition known as illiquidity Moreover the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> market that sorely misses them Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> market But the big often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Dapuzzo</ENAMEX> head of retail equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> acknowledges that he wasn t troubled by program trading when it began in the pre crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising We weren t as concerned until they became sell programs says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dapuzzo</ENAMEX> who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman</ENAMEX> however executes program trades for clients <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> do program trade <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> stocks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> say they do so only for customers however <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> does program trading for its own as well as clients accounts Of course there were sell programs in past years too but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days That s largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled Market makers to cut costs slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren t selling And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress On days when prices are tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will In such an environment market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you re going to lose says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Antolini</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> But this skittishness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Antolini</ENAMEX> says is creating liquidity problems in certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> stocks It s harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don t want to take the orders No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Hardiman</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX> of Securities Dealers which oversees trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> agrees that program trading is hurting the market s efforts to bring back small investors But he observes while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher Sometimes traders lose sight of that he says The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> stocks in the S P 500 include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> s biggest such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer MCI Communications Tele</ENAMEX> Communications and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz Claiborne</ENAMEX> These big stocks greatly influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Composite Index</ENAMEX> When the computers say sell the composite tumbles as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> The problem market makers say is that while the industrial average and the S P 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Composite</ENAMEX> frequently is left behind Eight trading days after Oct 12 the day before the stock market plunge for instance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Composite</ENAMEX> had fallen 4 3 compared with 3 3 for the S P 500 3 5 for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Stock Exchange Composite Index</ENAMEX> and 3 6 for the industrial average This gap eventually closes but slowly Three days later as of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> s close the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Composite</ENAMEX> was down 6 compared with 5 9 for the industrial average 5 7 for the S P 500 and 5 8 for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board Composite</ENAMEX> The main reason for this lag is that individual investors own 65 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> market s capitalization according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hardiman</ENAMEX> much more than on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> Such
