<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Mather</ENAMEX> whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> earlier this year will see its profit margins bounce back to the 11 5 range in 1990 said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> the agency s new chairman elect The ad agency s pretax profit margins were slightly under 10 at the time of the takeover according to analysts <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> s goal is to increase margins to 12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British</ENAMEX> born the 24 year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> veteran was named last week to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX> who is leaving by year s end to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> client Surrounded by stacks of paper two computers and photos of himself boating and flying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency First and foremost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> said he hopes to improve client service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> under the fastidious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> gained a reputation as occasionally being high handed in its treatment of clients of preaching what strategy a client should indeed must follow And some of its top client service executives including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties with little time to see clients But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy He also plans to get to know clients that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> was closer to such as Lever Brothers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business not once a month but two or three times a week he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover The reorganization is supposed to make one stop shopping buying advertising public relations and design all in one place or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Orchestration</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogilvyspeak</ENAMEX> a reality Under the reorganization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> plans to name one executive on each account as a client service director to work as the client s single contact for all those services There is little or no integration of our work quality is spotty there is no single focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> complained to staffers in March when the reorganization was announced Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express American Telephone Telegraph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryder</ENAMEX> by year s end <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry</ENAMEX> executives and analysts are divided on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> is up to the task He isn t as well known to clients as is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> Under his watch office politicking was often rampant in the agency s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> operation and the office there has had a dismal new business record for more than a year And while last week the agency hired a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiat</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Hamilton</ENAMEX> to try to bolster its work <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> has to get the revenue of that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office moving says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dougherty</ENAMEX> an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Natwest</ENAMEX> Securities The one thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> clearly does have going for him is continuity although it isn t certain if that will be enough As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dougherty</ENAMEX> says The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> is obviously a long term member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Mafia</ENAMEX> as we call it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> are indeed quite similar in substance if not in style While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> is a workaholic detailsman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> would rather delegate leaving him time for his interests outside the office <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> by contrast seems rarely to cut loose at all although he did appear at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Halloween</ENAMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> decked out in duck feet and a duck hat costumed as a lame duck <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> said the company s expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable given that the company s profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious oversized new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> headquarters The move budgeted at about 7 million actually came in at about 10 million he said But margins will be helped too by some other cost saving steps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> eliminated the mail room staff closed the executive dining room and after the takeover let go half a dozen financial executives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands on way instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> s new headquarters building to outsiders The fact that the agency will now be part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> company under British accounting rules will also make the profit picture look better Y R s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein Steps Down Arthur Klein</ENAMEX> president of Young Rubicam s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office stepped down temporarily in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Haven Conn</ENAMEX> that he the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 In an internal memo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kroll</ENAMEX> the agency s chairman said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Klein</ENAMEX> decided to remove himself to minimize negative reaction from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y R Mr Kroll</ENAMEX> wrote He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Klein</ENAMEX> will return to his post at the end of the trial at which he will be vindicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Klein</ENAMEX> will work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kroll</ENAMEX> on some of the agency s joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Georgescu</ENAMEX> president of Y R s ad operations will assume <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr
