British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airways PLC</ENAMEX> a crucial participant in the proposed buy out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp</ENAMEX> washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Airlines Specifically the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> In addition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> officially withdrew its support for the previous 300 a share bid in a terse statement that said the original deal is closed Company officials said later that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> believes its involvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy out ended last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> when the buy out group which also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> s management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the 6 79 billion transaction The carrier stopped short of saying it wouldn t at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> However company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to resurrect the transaction and aren t aware of any restructured bid in the making Collectively the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> will ever get off the ground The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> with no signs or statements from the buy out group to indicate that any progress has taken place However in response to the British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX> decision <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> s pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilot</ENAMEX> union <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman Frederick C Dubinsky</ENAMEX> said advisers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> management and the union will begin meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL s</ENAMEX> board at the earliest time possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilot</ENAMEX> union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> s participation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> declined to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> s statement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Chairman Stephen M Wolf</ENAMEX> who is leading the management end of the buy out hasn t provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal In another setback yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> s machinist union asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy out proposal violated tax laws In an effort to derail the buy out the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Commission Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> But there was one bright spot yesterday The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> flight attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake The pilot union the only one to support the buy out thus far said the flight attendants decision enforces our belief that an all employee owned airline is practical and achievable Still without the assurance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> financial backing it will be tougher for the buy out group to convince already reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> s original investment represented 78 of the cash equity contribution for the bid Under the previous plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> would have received a 15 stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> in exchange for a 750 million equity investment with a 75 stake going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> employees and 10 to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> officials said the airline s chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord King</ENAMEX> was concerned about news reports indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier The previous reports were based on remarks by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> s chief financial officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Stevens</ENAMEX> who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> s stock in the past week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock dropped 1 625 yesterday to 190 125 on volume of 923 500 shares in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Stock Exchange UAL</ENAMEX> declined to comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> s statement In an interview <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wednesday</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Professional Investor Report Mr Stevens</ENAMEX> said We re in no way committed to a deal going through at all We re not rushing into anything We don t want to be party to a second rejection Indeed British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX> seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment The original transaction fell through on the same day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts The buy out consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing a British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX> spokesman said British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> s Airlines new owners to restructure the equity contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM Royal Dutch</ENAMEX> Airlines in that carrier Most of the department s statements since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> carriers Even before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> s announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> yesterday to consider their options The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wednesday</ENAMEX> by the union s advisers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton Garrison</ENAMEX> They also unanimously re elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dubinsky</ENAMEX> the union chairman who has led the pilots 2 1 2 year fight to take control of the airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> s advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction The buy out fell through after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chase Manhattan Corp</ENAMEX> the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain 7 2 billion in financing needed for the plan
