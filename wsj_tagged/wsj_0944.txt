Two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography These decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars and from journalists as well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Miller</ENAMEX> s Bare Faced Messiah The True Story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L Ron Hubbard</ENAMEX> is a biography of the founder of the Church of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scientology Mr Hubbard</ENAMEX> who died in 1986 bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church which licensed them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Era Publications</ENAMEX> a Danish corporation In 1988 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Era</ENAMEX> sought a permanent injunction to restrain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Holt Co</ENAMEX> from publishing Bare Faced Messiah on the ground that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> s quotations from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hubbard</ENAMEX> infringed the copyrights The publisher argued in response that the fair use statute permits quotation for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship or research <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">District Court Judge Pierre Leval</ENAMEX> denied the injunction on the ground that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Era</ENAMEX> had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time the doctrine lawyers call laches As for the merits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Leval</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> had written a serious book of responsible historical criticism Verbatim quotation the judge believed was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hubbard</ENAMEX> mendacity bigotry paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hubbard</ENAMEX> s own words The biographer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Leval</ENAMEX> wrote should not be required simply to express conclusions without defending them by example In such circumstances free speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Leval</ENAMEX> felt constrained by an earlier decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Circuit Court</ENAMEX> forbidding a biographer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J D Salinger</ENAMEX> to quote from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Salinger</ENAMEX> s personal letters He distinguished the two cases In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger Judge Leval</ENAMEX> noted the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject Still the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Leval</ENAMEX> reluctantly concluded that a few of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> s quotations from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hubbard</ENAMEX> s unpublished writings because they were not necessary to prove historical points failed the fair use test and therefore infringed copyright But the proper remedy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Leval</ENAMEX> said lay in a suit for damages not in an injunction The case went on appeal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Circuit</ENAMEX> In a decision in April of this year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Roger Miner</ENAMEX> joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Frank Altimari</ENAMEX> agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that Bare Faced Messiah was a serious work but rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Leval</ENAMEX> s argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright We conclude the two judges wrote that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction Had the suit been filed in time they said Bare Faced Messiah would have been suppressed This was too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oakes</ENAMEX> the court s chief judge In a powerful separate opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Oakes</ENAMEX> further distinguished the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> case by pointing out that a living person like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Salinger</ENAMEX> had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hubbard</ENAMEX> I thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us This case realizes that concern Decisions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Circuit</ENAMEX> itself <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Oakes</ENAMEX> continued had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use And the injunction <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judges Miner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altimari</ENAMEX> would so readily have granted had <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Era</ENAMEX> sued in time Suppression of the book <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Oakes</ENAMEX> observed would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the First Amendment Moreover and here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Oakes</ENAMEX> went to the heart of the question Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources letters diaries and memoranda Indeed it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information Now scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation And of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries But in the Bare Faced Messiah case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points Judges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> understand the requirements of historical scholarship <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judges Miner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altimari</ENAMEX> do not appear to have a clue Yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law As matters stand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> ruling torn from context and broadly construed is controlling If an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished copyrighted materials as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> decision had it he deserves to be enjoined The courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers I understand take it to mean about 50 words The Bare Faced Messiah decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise A second decision handed down in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> of Appeals for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth Circuit</ENAMEX> is another blow against scholarship <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Malcolm</ENAMEX> a professional writer on psychiatric matters wrote a series of articles for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> later published in book form by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX> under the title In the Freud Archives The articles were largely based on interviews <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Malcolm</ENAMEX> had taped with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Masson</ENAMEX> a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the Freud Archives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> then brought a libel suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Malcolm</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX> As a public figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> had to prove malice and as proof of malice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Malcolm</ENAMEX> were in fact fabricated The quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Malcolm</ENAMEX> and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we assume the quotations were deliberately altered For all historians and most journalists this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> articles But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Arthur Alarcon</ENAMEX> joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall</ENAMEX> took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks In his eloquent dissent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Alex Kozinski</ENAMEX> observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker s precise words or at least his words purged of uh and you know and grammatical error While judges have an obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a concomitant of a free press <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Malcolm</ENAMEX> for example wrote that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> described himself as the greatest analyst who ever lived No such statement appears on the tapes The majority cited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> s remark It s me alone against the rest of the analytic world as warrant for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> fabrication But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Kozinski</ENAMEX> noted the context shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> s me alone remark referred not to his alleged pre eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Malcolm</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> describing himself as an intellectual gigolo Again no such statement appears on the tapes The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> s description of himself as a private asset but a public liability to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Freud</ENAMEX> and that in any case it was not defamatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Kozinski</ENAMEX> found the derivation entirely strained and writes that for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is a devastating admission of professional dishonesty These were only two of a series of fabrications that had in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Kozinski</ENAMEX> s words the cumulative effect of making <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> appear more arrogant less sensitive shallower more self aggrandizing and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Coles</ENAMEX> wrote in a review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Malcolm</ENAMEX> s book <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Masson</ENAMEX> emerges as a grandiose egotist and in the end a self destructive fool But it is not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Malcolm</ENAMEX> who calls him such his own words reveal this psychological profile We now know that the words were not always his own There is one sacred rule of journalism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hersey</ENAMEX> has said The writer must not invent Should the green light Judges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alarcon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians and for citizens As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Kozinski</ENAMEX> put it To invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more The historical profession will survive these decisions Perhaps in time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will correct them But writing history is tough enough without judges gratuitously throwing obstacles in the scholar s path <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Schlesinger</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Schweitzer</ENAMEX> professor of the humanities at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and a winner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulitzer</ENAMEX> Prizes in history and biography
