The current debate over reinvigorating individual retirement accounts boils down to this Would you prefer your tax break as an appetizer or as dessert Democrats would give taxpayers an immediate incentive to sock away more savings Save 2 000 and you can deduct 1 000 on your tax return Republicans would defer the tax break Save 2 000 and you ll escape taxes on all the interest that sum earns over the years till you retire Addressing the nation s savings shortage is once again politically fashionable And there is ample reason for concern The dearth of savings limits the resources available for investment in the future and forces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> to import foreign savings But some economists suggest the politicians new infatuation with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX> may be misplaced at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the president aren t taking the more important step of shrinking the federal budget deficit If increasing savings is the object says economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Gravelle</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Research Service</ENAMEX> a reduction in the deficit would be a more certain and more powerful way of achieving such an end The nation s total savings is what s left after substracting government borrowing from household and corporate savings The differences between the two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> alternatives involve more than partisan manuevering although there s plenty of that The shortcoming of offering immediate rewards for putting money in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> as the Democrats propose is that it will widen the budget deficit by an estimated 12 5 billion over the next five years The big problem is the up front cost says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen William Roth R Del</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX> cheerleader for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX> The shortcomings of delaying the reward as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Roth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sen Robert Packwood R Ore</ENAMEX> propose is that it may not boost savings much and if it does it may widen deficits in the future It looks like you haven t given anything away but five 10 20 40 years later little bomblets go off says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Aaron</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings Institution</ENAMEX> economist Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> fans in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> have been talking about restoring incentives that were curtailed in 1986 they gained momentum only after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen D Texas</ENAMEX> seized on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX> as an alternative to cutting capital gains taxes Republican senators unwilling to concede the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> issue to Democrats suddenly embraced a scheme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Roth</ENAMEX> had been pressing with little success The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration which was planning to unveil an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> proposal of its own next year was quick to do the same Both proposals would allow withdrawals not only for retirement but also for buying a house or paying tuition bills Between 1981 and 1986 any worker could put 2 000 a year into an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> and deduct that sum from his taxable income As banks and mutual funds advertised heavily hundreds of billions of dollars flowed into the accounts Economists still disagree on how much was new savings and how much was shifts of existing savings by taxpayers in order to cut their tax bill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Economist David Wise</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> figures 70 was actually new savings many prominent economists including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Boskin</ENAMEX> chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Advisers</ENAMEX> agree that Iras did result in significant new savings But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Aaron</ENAMEX> among others continues to insist that the data are inconclusive And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mcintyre</ENAMEX> director of the labor backed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Citizens</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Justice</ENAMEX> and an admirer of the 1986 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Reform Act</ENAMEX> that limited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX> goes further They don t work he contends They just give people a tax break for savings they would have done anyway In any event <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> contributions fell sharply after the 1986 law that restricted the full tax break to couples earning less than 40 000 a year and individuals earning less than 25 000 Balances in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Keogh</ENAMEX> accounts retirement accounts for the self employed which had swelled by 75 billion in 1986 grew by only 48 billion in 1988 including interest on past contributions It isn t clear how Americans would react to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> proposals because they are so different from the old scheme Some economists predict any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> plan will boost savings because brokerage houses mutual funds and banks will advertise them heavily It may well be that saving like life insurance is sold not bought says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Summers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> He notes that as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> ads vanished even many middle income Americans still eligible for the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> tax break stopped contributing Comparing the two proposals on the table many economists say a rational person ought to prefer the Republican version because it offers a much bigger tax break Under the Democratic plan a 40 year old in the 33 tax bracket who saves 2 000 in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> would cut his tax bill by 175 immediately When he retires 25 years later his 2 000 assuming it were invested at 5 would be worth 6 773 But 5 773 of that would be taxed when withdrawn from the Republicans wouldn t give any up front deduction for depositing 2 000 in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> But at retirement 25 years later the entire 4 773 in interest could be withdrawn taxfree along with the already taxed 2 000 initial contribution Nonetheless some economists argue that Americans simply won t save unless the government gives them an immediate reward This instant gratification overcomes the usual bias against savings says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Skinner</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> economist The clincher he says is that people who owed money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> were far more likely to put money in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> than those who were due a refund On the other hand the case for delayed gratification is bolstered by evidence that a surprising number of upper income Americans still are putting money in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX> even though the only tax break is deferring tax on the interest the contributions earn The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee Benefit Research Institute</ENAMEX> says about 23 of all workers earning more than 50 000 a year made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> deposits in 1987 down from 56 in 1982 but still nearly one million people <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Underwood</ENAMEX> head of retirement planning for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Co</ENAMEX> says he was surprised to discover that more money flowed into the firm s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> accounts in 1988 than in 1987 A big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> fan <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Underwood</ENAMEX> s license plate reads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> is convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican IRA</ENAMEX> plan would appeal to its customers and it is lobbying strongly for it I think people are really concerned about what the tax rate will be in the future <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Underwood</ENAMEX> says The higher tax rates go in the future of course the more valuable the future tax breaks The bigger the incentive the government offers for savings the more tax revenues a scheme would lose or so many economists reason But that s not how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Roth</ENAMEX> and his allies look at it First they would allow people with old fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX> to shift the money to the new ones as long as they pay tax at today s lower tax rates on the previously deducted contributions That would raise 11 5 billion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> over the next five years congressonal tax experts estimate But allowing the interest buildup on those contributions to escape taxation would cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> far more than that sum in the long run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> says It s a huge giveaway <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Summers</ENAMEX> protests <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Second Sen Roth</ENAMEX> insists that the extra savings his plan would produce would spur so much extra economic growth that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> wouldn t suffer The claim is an echo of the supply side promise that the 1981 tax cuts that bear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Roth</ENAMEX> s name would finance themselves through added growth or added savings home contribution purchase of home college tuition and books catastrophic health expenses tax free law would continue to have that
