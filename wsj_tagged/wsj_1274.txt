Americans are drinking less but young professionals from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> are rushing to buy premium brand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> vodka brandy and other spirits In particular many are snubbing the scotch preferred by their parents and opting for bourbon the sweet firewater from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> countryside With U S liquor consumption declining steadily many American producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad And those efforts are paying off Spirits exports jumped more than 2 1 2 times to 157 2 million in 1988 from 59 8 million in 1983 according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distilled Spirits Council</ENAMEX> of the U S a trade group Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bellas</ENAMEX> president of Beverage Marketing Corp a research and consulting firm If you want to be a player you have to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> You must have world class brands a long term perspective and deep pockets The internationalization of the industry has been hastened by foreign companies acquisitions of many U S producers In recent years for example <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heublein Inc</ENAMEX> while another British company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness PLC</ENAMEX> took over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Distillers Group</ENAMEX> and Schenley Industries <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> But the shift has also been fueled by necessity While premium brand spirits like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smirnoff</ENAMEX> vodka and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Daniel</ENAMEX> s whiskey are riding high in the U S domestic spirits consumption fell 15 to 141 1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979 In recent years growth has come in the foreign markets U S brandy exports more than doubled last year to 360 000 proof gallons a standard industry measure according

though have been made by bourbon While U S makers of vodka rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon All bourbon comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Daniel</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste Moreover just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the U S bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore How
