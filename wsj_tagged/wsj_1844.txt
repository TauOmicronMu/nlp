whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Della Femina Mcnamee WCRS</ENAMEX> agency created liar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Isuzu</ENAMEX> among others announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> The complex restructuring which was long expected transforms <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> from primarily a creator of advertising into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> s largest buyers of advertising time and space It also creates a newly merged world wide ad agency controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and headed jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> ad man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Della Femina</ENAMEX> and two top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> executives The merged agency s admittedly ambitious goal to become one of the world s 10 largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> s restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> meanwhile the move gives it a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world wide It also gives the outspoken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Della Femina</ENAMEX> who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly won t be loath to use According to terms <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> will pay 2 02 billion French francs 318 6 million for the 50 it doesn t already own of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat Holding S A</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> s largest media buyers Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> which had held 20 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> s ad unit will pay 43 5 million 68 5 million to raise its stake to 60 That price also covers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> raising to 60 its 51 stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belier Group</ENAMEX> a joint venture ad agency network it owns with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS Eurocom</ENAMEX> will also have the right to buy the remaining 40 of the merged ad agency group in six years The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWDB</ENAMEX> The merged agency will include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Eurocom</ENAMEX> s various agencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belier Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> s other advertising and direct marketing operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Della Femina</ENAMEX> will be joint chairman with former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Wight Both</ENAMEX> will report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Breene</ENAMEX> a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency In an interview in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Mr Breene</ENAMEX> fresh from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concorde</ENAMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> where executives had worked through most of the night outlined big plans for the new agency Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top 10 position by the end of three years from now It implies very dramatic growth he said He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> had agreed to provide a development fund of 100 million for acquisitions The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Breene</ENAMEX> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia Germany</ENAMEX> and elsewhere Cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> had billings of just 660 million last year and ranked as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> s 24th largest ad agency The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than 2 6 billion most of that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> bringing it to about 14th world wide To make it to top 10 status it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey Advertising D Arcy Masius Benton Bowles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnicom</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX> The merged agency s game plan to attract multinational packaged goods advertisers may prove equally difficult When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> created <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee</ENAMEX> out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 it said it did so in order to attract larger clients especially packaged goods companies Since then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> won <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> as an international client and also does work for a few packaged goods clients including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Co</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saran Wrap</ENAMEX> But major packaged goods players of the world such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter Gamble Colgate Palmolive</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> have steadfastly eluded the agency Three of our favorite names <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Della Femina</ENAMEX> calls that roster adding hopefully We re a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday Still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media buying firms that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> has seen As part of the restructuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> What s more both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and brothers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Gross</ENAMEX> who founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> will acquire 14 99 stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS Group</ENAMEX> creating a powerful link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat Carat</ENAMEX> will receive its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> stake as part of payment for the 50 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> stake that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> is buying while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> said it expects to pay about 32 million for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> stake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Della Femina</ENAMEX> says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world wide agency serving as a sort of creative conscience <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise Mcnamee Della Femina s</ENAMEX> president will continue running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> agency day to day They and other top executives signed long term employment contracts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Della Femina</ENAMEX> will receive an additional multimillion dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about 10 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS Group</ENAMEX> for its part will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming a holding company for a series of media related businesses said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Scott</ENAMEX> the firm s chief executive In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat WCRS</ENAMEX> will hold onto its public relations TV programming and other businesses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> says its debt will be cut to 24 million from 66 million as a result of the transaction For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> meanwhile the alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> is intended to strengthen its own push outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France Carat</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> brothers invented the idea of large scale buying of media space By buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as 50 which they can pass on to customers They thus have won the French space buying business of such advertising giants as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca Cola Co Fiat S</ENAMEX> p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Gillette</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> But now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media buying groups and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> wants to expand to the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> To help finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> said it plans an issue of Euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged medium term debt financing which would be underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Montagu Co Ltd Earthquake</ENAMEX> s Damage Tuesday s earthquake brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
