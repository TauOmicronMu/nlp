With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> one of the many lingering questions the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration will ponder is this Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> staff big enough and does it have enough clout to do its job of coordinating foreign policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> s national security adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lt Gen Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX> came into office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> intent on making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Scowcroft</ENAMEX> was a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower Commission</ENAMEX> which investigated the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran Contra</ENAMEX> affair He was all too aware of how a large inadequately supervised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Reagan</ENAMEX> s second term So following both the style he pursued as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President Ford</ENAMEX> s national security adviser and the recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower Commission Gen Scowcroft</ENAMEX> has pruned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks namely gathering the views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department Pentagon</ENAMEX> and intelligence community serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower Commission</ENAMEX> specifically said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff should be small and warned against letting energetic self starters like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lt Col Oliver North</ENAMEX> strike out on their own rather than leaving the day to day execution of policies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department Pentagon</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> However the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> episode has raised questions about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff is sufficiently big diverse and powerful to coordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> policy on tough issues During the coup attempt and its aftermath <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffers were stretched very thin says one senior administration official It s a very small shop <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Scowcroft</ENAMEX> doesn t plan to increase the staff right now but is weighing that possibility the official adds The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff doesn t have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gaffney</ENAMEX> a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> aide who now runs the Center for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Policy</ENAMEX> a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> think tank The problem with this administration I think is that by design it has greatly diminished both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need in an increasingly complex world for a formal system within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department Pentagon</ENAMEX> and intelligence agencies By law the council includes the president vice president and secretaries of state and defense In practice the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members But the size shape and role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide That task is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> s perennial problems In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush White House</ENAMEX> the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> s staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 administration officials say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials insist that the size of the staff wasn t a problem during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> crisis But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffer most experienced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America Everett Briggs</ENAMEX> was gone He had just resigned at least in part because of a feud with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assistant Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">State Bernard Aronson</ENAMEX> over the administration s policy on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> and support for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> rebels The absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Briggs</ENAMEX> underscored the possible inadequacy of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Both Gen Scowcroft</ENAMEX> and his deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gates</ENAMEX> are experts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S Soviet</ENAMEX> affairs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Scowcroft</ENAMEX> is particularly well versed in arms control and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gates</ENAMEX> has spent years studying Soviet politics and society Both have become confidants of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> But neither has an extensive background in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> In those areas the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffers under them therefore have become more important <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Scowcroft</ENAMEX> knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> bureaus But just as every previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> adviser has Gen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX> now will have to mull at what point the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff becomes too lean and too restrained
