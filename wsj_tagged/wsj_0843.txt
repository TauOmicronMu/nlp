For a company that sells billions of dollars in military hardware each year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop Corp</ENAMEX> is pressing awfully hard to get back a mere 6 250 000 The missing funds and the way they ve been accounted for are at the center of a long running dispute between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> aerospace company and a well connected Korean enterprise called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia Culture Travel Development Co</ENAMEX> Since news of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> s Korean dealings became public last year the company has insisted that it sunk the money into a proposed hotel venture in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> losing everything when it was bamboozled by Korean con men The Koreans say that the hotel was a ruse from the beginning and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> really intended to bribe government officials to buy its ill fated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F</ENAMEX> 20 Tigershark jet fighter Now a document released by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Energy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> subcommittee alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> tried to cover up those purportedly illicit payments by forging signatures shuffling millions of dollars in and out of banks and even paying hush money to middlemen who threatened to disclose the scam to the authorities Some of the allegations were given to the subcommittee during testimony in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> 1988 But the document featuring a passel of new details is sure to revive interest in the matter on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> where lawmakers this week are deciding on appropriations for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> s most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> program the B 2 Stealth bomber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Culture Travel</ENAMEX> submitted the document as part of its legal defense to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Chamber</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> which is arbitrating the case between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Culture Travel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop One</ENAMEX> subcommittee investigator who works for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman John Dingell D Mich</ENAMEX> called the information a major step forward in its own inquiry A federal grand jury also is actively trying to determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Northrop</ENAMEX> has strongly denied any illegalities It said that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> it made an extensive filing to the chamber that rebuts point by point the allegations by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia Culture Travel A</ENAMEX> copy wasn t immediately available In a May 8 filing to the chamber though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> stressed its view that this is not a complex case but is instead a straightforward breach of contract dispute The company added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Culture Travel</ENAMEX> s allegations are so contradictory and inconsistent that they provide powerful evidence that the Koreans deceived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> by pitching the hotel project But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Culture Travel</ENAMEX> lays out a much different story in its 52 page brief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> s first contact with the Koreans this version of the tangled events goes occurred in the summer of 1983 when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express Co</ENAMEX> a bus company that was run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Minha</ENAMEX> His brother in law was the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park Chong Kyu</ENAMEX> a powerful businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park</ENAMEX> the pistol packing owner of a notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> night spot called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safari Club</ENAMEX> was a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee</ENAMEX> with easy access to the highest echelons of the Korean government The brief alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> by way of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX> based consultant named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Shin</ENAMEX> proposed the idea of selling to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX> as many as 200 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F</ENAMEX> 20s through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express</ENAMEX> which was to receive a 2 commission with a 55 million cap As part of the arrangement the document contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> was asked to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sofitel Seoul</ENAMEX> a high class hotel that was to be built on the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express</ENAMEX> garage Though it is typical for American companies to invest in foreign countries in which they want to trade arms thereby offsetting the cost of currency conversion on its contracts to the overseas government it was still initially puzzling why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> approached a bus company to do it I first thought it made no sense to offer to an express bus company the distribution of up to date fighters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> told public prosecutors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> who have also investigated the situation according to the document But later I learned that it was not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park Chong Kyu</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> aimed to contact In May 1984 the document asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> officials met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park</ENAMEX> known best to Americans as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C K Park</ENAMEX> and allegedly asked him to perform promotional activities for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F</ENAMEX> 20 The brief says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park</ENAMEX> then asked for 5 million up front adding that he could procure such expenses from the budget for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sofitel Hotel</ENAMEX> project if approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> declined the brief says when its representatives pointed out that a payoff would be illegal and such a payment if done would constitute a scandal Yet the document alleges that it didn t take long before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park</ENAMEX> devised a new scheme to funnel the money The conduit the filing insists was to be another hotel project this time a joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Culture Travel</ENAMEX> another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> affiliated concern Promotional materials touting Asia <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culture Travel</ENAMEX> were delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> and appear to have been signed by Kang Oh Hyun an official of the firm in fact the filing alleges they were forged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shin</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> consultant The brief says other procedural forms relating to the joint venture appear to have been signed by four Asia <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culture Travel</ENAMEX> shareholders when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in the summer of 1984 for the Olympic Games But three of the holders the filing says weren t in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> at the time On Aug 9 1984 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park</ENAMEX> that 6 250 000 had been deposited to an account in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> that he controlled Everything the arbitration filing suggests seemed set That is at least until October when during a test flight an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F</ENAMEX> 20 crashed The pilot was killed and the aircraft destroyed Shortly thereafter another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F</ENAMEX> 20 crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> during a demonstration and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> eventually gave up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F</ENAMEX> 20 program after out of pocket expenditures of more than 1 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Park</ENAMEX> died of cancer in 1985 Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> s own board began inquiring about what happened to the hotel the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul Palace</ENAMEX> it was to be called and the 6 250 000 It was at that point the filing alleges that a cover up began First the brief says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> wanted to formally cancel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express</ENAMEX> the earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sofitel Hotel</ENAMEX> transaction that had been proposed The idea the filing alleges was to be able to transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express</ENAMEX> 3 5 million in termination fees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Foulds</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> executive even allegedly drafted the settlement claim for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express Mr Foulds</ENAMEX> s attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Handzlik</ENAMEX> said his client denies that he engaged in any improper activity in respect to the Korean hotel project including any cover up activities That money investigators for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> subcommittee said was in turn designed to be handed back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> to help it account for more than half of the missing 6 250 000 Of the remainder the filing maintains 1 750 000 could be chalked up to expenses and 1 million was available through a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> bank account But the filing says that plan had to be killed when the blackmailers appear The first allegedly was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express</ENAMEX> middleman who told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dorsey</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> marketing executive that he would publish all the facts concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> s efforts to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F</ENAMEX> 20 to the Korean government the document says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Both Mr Dorsey</ENAMEX> and his lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Bookin</ENAMEX> declined to comment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welko Gasich</ENAMEX> then a top <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> executive allegedly handed over 1 5 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong Yang Express</ENAMEX> which passed on 500 000 to silence the middleman the document claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gasich</ENAMEX> declined to comment the middleman couldn t be located In early 1987 the arbitration filing asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shin</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> consultant demanded 2 million to remain silent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shin</ENAMEX> who is being sued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX> couldn t be reached It was then that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> filed suit against the Koreans in what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> investigators claim was an attempt to make it look as if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> had been swindled The company is asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Chamber</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> to order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Culture Travel</ENAMEX> and its associates to return the 6 250 000 plus interest at the highest lawful rate
