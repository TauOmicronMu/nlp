<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Lang</ENAMEX> who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> is candid about the challenge he is taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> admits that Ms is in dire straits and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive But the 57 year old publisher has moved quickly and boldly to deal with the magazines problems Last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> he told the staff of Ms that the magazine in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> would begin publishing without advertising <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> will do away with expensive circulation drives not to mention sales staff and attempt to publish the 17 year old magazine supported by circulation revenue alone Any fool can publish a money losing magazine I want to publish one that succeeds said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> For Ms it s time to publish for the reader not the advertiser As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> which competes directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp</ENAMEX> s Seventeen magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> says that in the next two years he will spend 6 million promoting and improving the magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Though Sassy</ENAMEX> has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988 it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen age problems <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> said the former Australian owners of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> were blind sided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral Majority Their</ENAMEX> reaction was to do nothing and ride it out He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> will keep its irreverent tone but added We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> already has recovered circulation has quickly passed the 500 000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300 What s more <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> says he has what all publishers wish for a bona fide niche Seventeen is written more for mothers not their daughters said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> has a different spirit It gets more mail in a month than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s got in a year and it s not from mothers I feel about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> like I did about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> 10 years ago <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> took on Ms and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda Publications Inc</ENAMEX> by his newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang Communications Lang</ENAMEX> owns 70 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> owns the rest through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp Venture Capital Partners</ENAMEX> Two weeks ago <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> pumped 800 000 into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda</ENAMEX> just to keep the doors open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry</ENAMEX> observers have congratulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> on what some call his courageous handling of Ms but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews Besides Ms and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> two monthly magazines Working Woman with circulation near one million and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> with 625 000 circulation are legitimate magazine success stories The magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> however was for years lackluster and unfocused Only recently has it been attractively redesigned and its editorial product improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture</ENAMEX> another magazine for growing companies Working Woman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> have operated as part of Working <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woman Mccall</ENAMEX> s Group a less than successful joint venture between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc</ENAMEX> The joint venture is being undone with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s magazine being sold last summer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Times Co s Magazine Group</ENAMEX> for about 80 million and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> agreeing to sell back its 50 interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> Executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc Magazine Co</ENAMEX> a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> have said the joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> wasn t a good one The venture formed in 1986 was supposed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s low cost safe entry into women s magazines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine publishers In addition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s put in a less than stellar performance Until a recent comeback it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality and in the end one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executive who asked not to be identified said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankly Mccall</ENAMEX> s and the joint venture were an embarrassment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s priorities changed Their management changed right after the venture was formed and I don t think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women s service magazines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Today Mr Lang</ENAMEX> believes his magazines will offer what many women s magazines don t We write straight for women on their level he said We don t have passive readers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> points out that even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> in part fits the company s image since about 30 of its readership is female <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> has named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Taber</ENAMEX> 43 as group publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> She will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman Working Mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> magazines and retain her post as publisher of Working Woman The sale price of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s twice what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lang</ENAMEX> originally paid for it will finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> buy back of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> s 50 interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother Mr Lang</ENAMEX> says he isn t scouting new acquisitions at least for now We would have to go outside to banks to get the money and I am not ready to do that he said Besides we have enough on our plate There is plenty of work to be done on what we have
