The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981 casting a solid 382 37 vote for a compromise measure backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor Advocates said the 90 cent an hour rise to 4 25 an hour by April 1991 is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> and Democratic leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> after congressional Republicans urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise So both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four year law was enacted in 1977 raising the wage to 3 35 an hour from 2 65 Under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to 3 80 next April The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it There are no smiles about this bill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep Pat Williams D Mont</ENAMEX> said during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> floor debate yesterday But because it s all we ve got I m going to vote for it While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U S manufacturing wage the level of 4 25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 of average factory pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Williams</ENAMEX> said But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep Marge Roukema R N J</ENAMEX> instead praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> s acceptance of a new youth training wage a subminimum that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> administrations have sought for many years Adopting a training wage policy means getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Roukema</ENAMEX> said Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> unions and Democrats long fought the idea but recently acceded to it in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration insistence The compromise sets the training wage at 3 35 an hour next April and at 3 61 an hour or 85 of the minimum wage in April 1991 Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another 90 days if the company uses a government certified training program for the young workers The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> previously insisted on an unrestricted six month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job The U S Chamber of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> still opposed to any mininum wage increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers
