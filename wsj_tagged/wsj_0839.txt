<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp</ENAMEX> asked a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> court to deny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> Communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> s request for an injunction preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Peters</ENAMEX> from taking over the management of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> The Japanese concern made its request in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Superior Court</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> last week filed a 1 billion breach of contract suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> are currently under contract to produce movies exclusively for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Sony</ENAMEX> which has agreed to pay 3 5 billion and to assume 1 5 billion in debt to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> is also offering 200 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters Entertainment Co</ENAMEX> of which the producers are co chairmen and own a combined 28 stake While executives from both sides say the matter still could be settled papers filed in the court by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> appear to heighten the acrimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> s most watched legal battle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> claims an injunction would leave it faced with the ominous possibility that it would complete a 5 billion entertainment company acquisition and be left with no management to run the company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> must be grinning from ear to ear at the possibility of leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> in such a position and at the opportunity to prevent the revitalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> into a strong competitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> disputes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> s contention that its offer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> violates their contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> which is in the process of being acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc Furthermore Sony</ENAMEX> claims that the contract as written and oral agreements that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has denied exist allow the producers to take on such executive posts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> s legal argument even raises the novel idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> could actually make movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> while serving in executive posts at another studio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> acknowledges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> s contract prevents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> team from being producers or executive producers of movies for another studio But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> says that doesn t exclude them from taking an executive post at another company where they would be involved in choosing movies and in managing but not in day to day production of movies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> could allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> to produce motion pictures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> as soon as the acquisition is consummated But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also says in its filing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> contract doesn t require that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> take any affirmative steps to produce motion pictures it simply rewards them when they do and prohibits them from producing for another entertainment company And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has already shown it doesn t need the producers by taking action to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> from completing production in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> properties Among the arguments <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> makes is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> should let the producers go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> because it already allowed the producers to become co chairmen of publicly held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris</ENAMEX> Industries <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> which earlier this year changed its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters Entertainment Sony</ENAMEX> also says in its filing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> were offered management posts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> once before in 1987 and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> approved and encouraged them to do so But in a sworn affidavit last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros Chairman Robert Daly</ENAMEX> denied that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Daly</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> had mentioned such an offer and that he responded that I thought the idea was a bad one from his point of view and I understand he dropped the idea shortly thereafter The two sides did some rival bashing yesterday as well In a sworn declaration <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Records unit said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Chairman Steven Ross</ENAMEX> has an anti Japanese anti <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> bias But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart Rabinowitz Warner</ENAMEX> s outside counsel says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> violates American business morality by secretly raiding major producers under exclusive contract to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> In another sworn declaration yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof</ENAMEX> said that while he was negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> he relied on the producers assurances that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> had previously agreed to let them terminate the contract and wouldn t have any trouble obtaining a release <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> meanwhile in his own sworn declaration yesterday maintained that running a studio has always been our professed goal and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives made an oral agreement that would free the producers from their contract should the opportunity arise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> in his declaration supported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> s claims and said he is shocked by the assertions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives that such an agreement was never made
