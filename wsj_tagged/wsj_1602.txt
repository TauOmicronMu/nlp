Your Oct 12 editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pitiful Helpless Presidency</ENAMEX> correctly states that I was critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration s failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> presented by the attempted military coup on Oct 3 You are absolutely wrong however in opining that this position is some kind of flip flop something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls My position is one founded on both the facts and the law Although you may have forgotten public opinion about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling and simultaneous work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> operative The public made up its mind about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> on Feb 8 9 10 and 11 1988 and again on April 4 1988 It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> s criminality and of his enduring relationships with a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> government agencies Those hearings also highlighted how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> action against him and to exploit the administration s obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug dealing As former Ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica Francis J Mcneil</ENAMEX> testified before the subcommittee the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration knew that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of 1986 to put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> on the shelf until <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> was settled As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded Our government did nothing regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> s drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> war This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> States as a hidden cost of the war Unfortunately this problem continued even after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> s indictment Throughout 1988 and this year I and others in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> have pressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> to develop a plan for pushing this narcokleptocrat out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama Regrettably</ENAMEX> two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan military or economic for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen John Kerry D</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Mass</ENAMEX>
