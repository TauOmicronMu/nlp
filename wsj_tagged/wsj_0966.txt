A few years ago I was on a panel of journalists that discussed the image of intercollegiate athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others We scribblers quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big time college sports richly earned but also that it could be corrected Competition could be maintained and stadiums probably would remain full if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students we said Comments from the audience reflected widespread if wistful agreement with those conclusions As the session broke up I was approached by a man who identified himself as the alumni director of a Big Ten university I d love to see sports cut back and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools but everybody s afraid to make the first move he confided It s like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> and the Russians Nobody wants to disarm first And so our institutions of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball court while the casualties mount Three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college sports show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it They are A
