Next to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</ENAMEX> s megabillion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> deal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Television</ENAMEX> is small fry But the troubles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> are a classic tale of the leveraged buy out excesses of the 1980s especially the asset stripping game <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> which expects to release a plan to restructure 1 3 billion of debt in the next day or so isn t just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt though it did do that The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO a set of assets that were leveraged twice enabling the blue chip buy out king <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> in 1987 to take more than 1 billion of cash out of the com pany <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s buy out was an ace in the hole for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kravis</ENAMEX> and for investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> partnerships But it has left holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s junk bonds holding the bag including some heavyweights that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> might need to finance future deals such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemper Financial</ENAMEX> Services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive Columbia</ENAMEX> Savings Loan and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> Some junk holders are said to be considering legal action against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> or moves to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy court And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> s majority partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville Tenn</ENAMEX> entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gillett</ENAMEX> also is said to be very unhappy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s six stations once were part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storer Communications KKR</ENAMEX> loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy out then later sold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX> s cable operations at a fat profit In 1987 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> for the second time piled debt onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX> s TV stations selling them for 1 3 billion to a new entity that was 45 owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and 55 owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett Corp</ENAMEX> which now operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> stations In this second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBO KKR</ENAMEX> with one hand took more than 1 billion of cash out of the TV company s assets and moved it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX> cable operations making them more valuable in a 1988 sale <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX> also took 125 million of junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds as partial payment for the TV assets With the other hand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> put back into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> less than 10 of the cash it had taken out buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> common and preferred shares So while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> today has an estimated 250 million sunk in now shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> including equity and debt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBO</ENAMEX> firm still is 1 billion ahead on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> buy out after taking cash up front On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX> as a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> racked up compound annual returns of 60 in the three years it owned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX> Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gillett</ENAMEX> risks losing his entire equity investment of about 100 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> if the company can t be restructured <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Overall Mr Gillett</ENAMEX> s holding company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillett Holdings</ENAMEX> is heavily indebted and except for its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vail Mountain</ENAMEX> resorts isn t doing very well With the TV business falling on hard times in recent years analysts say that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> had to be liquidated today it might fetch 30 less than in the 1987 buy out wiping out most of the company s junk holders and its stockholders Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can barely pay its cash interest bill and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s grace period for paying its bills is due to expire Nov 16 It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt Negotiations have started con structively but that s not to say we like this particular offer says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild Inc</ENAMEX> adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> junk holders No major player in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> deal will talk publicly But it s understood that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kravis</ENAMEX> is disappointed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gillett</ENAMEX> didn t manage to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s operating profit after the buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kravis</ENAMEX> apparently thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to sell assets to pay debt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gillett</ENAMEX> is said to be proud of his operating record he has lifted some stations ratings and turned around a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> station As for junk holders they re discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> The bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R D Smith Co</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> which trades distressed securities People who have seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s restructuring plan say it offers concessions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett Corp</ENAMEX> They would both give part of their combined 50 million in common equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s 488 million of junk bonds as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company But some militant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> junk holders say that s not enough They contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s equity now is worthless They add that it isn t costing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> anything to give up equity because of its big up front cash profit on the buy out which they think contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s current problems <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemper</ENAMEX> the biggest holder of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds has refused to join the bond holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options To protect their claims some junk holders want <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gillett</ENAMEX> to invest new money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> perhaps 50 million or more One investment banker who isn t involved in the deal says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> needs at least 50 million of new equity to survive Junk holders say they have a stick to beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> with The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool to extract money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> says one big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> holder This could be the first major bankruptcy law proceeding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> he adds A big bankruptcy court case might tarnish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> s name and provide new fuel for critics of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and elsewhere But others say junk holders have nothing to gain by putting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy law proceedings While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> doesn t control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Tvwhich</ENAMEX> is unusual for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> investment it clearly has much deeper pockets than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gillett Bankruptcy</ENAMEX> specialists say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kravis</ENAMEX> set a precedent for putting new money in sour <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> recently when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> restructured foundering Seaman Furniture doubling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> s equity stake But with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seaman KKR</ENAMEX> was only trying to salvage its original investment says bankruptcy investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rubin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sass Lamle Rubin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> By contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> probably has already made all the money it can on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> And people who know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kravis</ENAMEX> say he isn t in a hurry to pour more money into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>TV</ENAMEX>
