Two old friends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX> are trying to limit further damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S China</ENAMEX> ties But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> prepares a fresh package of sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> the already tense relationship could get worse The problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will be to weigh what <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is saying to its people against the more conciliatory message it is delivering to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration In a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Deng</ENAMEX> sent an indirect signal to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T D Lee</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX> physicist who met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Deng</ENAMEX> and other Chinese leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> last month When he met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> on his return <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> says he told the president that the Chinese made statements to me that I regard as a first step toward reconciliation The communication <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> brought represents the softer line the U S has been hoping to hear from Chinese officials since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> 4 massacre of pro democracy demonstrators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> The Chinese leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> expressed some regret for what had happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> and conceded that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s officials bore some responsibility <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Deng</ENAMEX> told him We should not mind those who participated in demonstrations signed anti government materials and went on hunger strikes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Deng</ENAMEX> added says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> that we really made mistakes We must not shirk our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> also reported to the president that in a separate meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang Zemin</ENAMEX> said the Chinese leadership looked kindly on the students who took part in the demonstrations <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jiang</ENAMEX> also pledged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese Red Cross</ENAMEX> would publish very soon a list of those killed And he told the physicist that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s leaders were very much concerned about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims families I transmitted my conversations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Prof Lee</ENAMEX> says But he adds I was not acting as a messenger He says that the Chinese never asked him to convey their statements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spontaneously invited him to do so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lee</ENAMEX> concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> but attributes that to the fact that the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is very complex According to U S sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> the administration hopes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Deng</ENAMEX> s fairly conciliatory comments will prod <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to be cautious about further sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> The president doesn t want to have legislative sanctions says a U S official But he may not have a choice <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Given China</ENAMEX> s far from conciliatory statements to its own people <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> may be unable to prevent new sanctions <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations Sentences have been stiff A university student got eight years for participating in the rallies sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> said while an 18 year old worker got 10 years Nor has <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed So far the victims are officially considered evil doers and their families receive no compensation A man gunned down by a stray bullet while cycling to work carries after his death the official stigma of counterrevolutionary his wife says What s more much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s official rhetoric is hostile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S China</ENAMEX> frequently lambastes the U S Embassy for harboring astrophysicist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fang Lizhi</ENAMEX> a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre In the U S there are still people who want to crush <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and interfere in our internal affairs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zhu Qizhen China</ENAMEX> s new ambassador to the U S said as he left for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> last week The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> are to begin soon hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation It will probably be attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> authorization bill which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> isn t expected to veto A congressional staffer involved in drafting the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> enacted shortly after the massacre But as legislative action they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to rescind Measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges a suspension of most high level government contacts and a halt to U S trade enhancement programs such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overseas Private Investment Corp</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Development Program Codifying</ENAMEX> those sanctions could prompt Chinese retaliation If the two sides aren t careful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S China</ENAMEX> ties could spin downward out of control says a U S official in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beijing Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> are hoping that cooler heads prevail
