Short interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over the counter stocks rose 6 as of mid October its biggest jump since 6 3 last April The most recent <ENAMEX

happens the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge However the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX> of Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dealers</ENAMEX> include only those trades completed or settled by Oct 13
