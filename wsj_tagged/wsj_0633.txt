by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> for a re enactment a dramatic rendering by an actor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hoffman</ENAMEX> s ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression The segment is soon to be broadcast on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> series <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturday Night</ENAMEX> With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX> thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news It is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Journalism</ENAMEX> come to television <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Chung</ENAMEX> s program is just one of several network shows and many more in syndication that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events using actors who are supposed to resemble real people living and dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Chung</ENAMEX> s however is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie Hoffman</ENAMEX> in this case is to be played by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lieber</ENAMEX> who isn t new to the character He was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hoffman</ENAMEX> in a 1979

Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Broadcast Group</ENAMEX> president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Stringer</ENAMEX> puts it the network now needs to broaden the horizons of nonfiction television and that includes some experimentation Since its premiere Sept 16 the show on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Chung</ENAMEX> appears has used an actor to portray the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev Vernon Johns</ENAMEX> a civil rights leader and one to play a teenage drug dealer It

applauds and that one night to the embarrassment of the network waved at the camera like the crowd on Let s Make a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deal ABC</ENAMEX> stops short of using an applause sign and a comic to warm up the audience The stars do that themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid Feders</ENAMEX> called Yesterday Today and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomorrow</ENAMEX> starring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maria Shriver Chuck Scarborough</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary

Productions which also makes the successful prime time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> series Unsolved Mysteries The marriage of news and theater if not exactly inevitable has been consummated nonetheless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News</ENAMEX> programs particularly if they score well in the ratings appeal to the networks cost conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is somewhere between 400 000 and 500 000 for a one hour program Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX> enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated tabloid TV shows as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">A Current Affair</ENAMEX> which is produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox Broadcasting Co</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp That</ENAMEX> show whose host is <ENAMEX

Chambers</ENAMEX> murder case the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Lowe</ENAMEX> tapes what have you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Stone</ENAMEX> the executive producer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">A Current Affair</ENAMEX> says We have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nowhere</ENAMEX> have eyes been opened wider than at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> At 555 W 57th <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> one floor below the offices of 60 Minutes the most

TYPE="PERSON">Mr Anderson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Alton</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Father Jenco</ENAMEX> but the network has some big names to contend with too <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Earl Jones</ENAMEX> is cast to play the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev Mr Johns Ned Beatty</ENAMEX> may portray former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Gov Pat Brown</ENAMEX> in a

has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen agers to a Nov 4 segment on a man named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Bosket</ENAMEX> who calls himself a monster and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York CBS News</ENAMEX> which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks now hires featured actors beginning at 2 700 a week That isn t much compared with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX> makes or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX> for that matter who is paid 1 6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> But the money isn t peanuts either particularly for a news program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> is also re enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middletown Pa</ENAMEX> with something less than a cast of thousands It is combing the town of 10 000 for about 200 extras On Oct 20 the town s mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Reid</ENAMEX> made an announcement on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> during half time at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middletown High School</ENAMEX> football game asking for volunteers There was a roll of laughter through the stands says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Sukle</ENAMEX> the editor of the weekly Press and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middletown</ENAMEX> They re filming right now at the bank down the street and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sukle</ENAMEX> says he wouldn t dream of participating himself No way I think re enactments stink Though a re enactment may have the flavor <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> it isn t Some producers seem tentative about the technique squeamish even So the results while not news aren t exactly theater either at least not good theater And some people do think that acting out scripts isn t worthy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry In his review of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturday Night</ENAMEX> With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung Tom Shales</ENAMEX> the TV critic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and generally an admirer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> wrote that while the show is impressive one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX> creating events has in general upset news traditionalists including former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News President Richard S Salant</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News President Reuven Frank</ENAMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> anchorman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Cronkite</ENAMEX> and the new dean of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University Graduate School</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Journalism Joan Konner</ENAMEX> Says she Once you add dramatizations it s no longer news it s drama and that has no place on a network news broadcast They should never be on Never Criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie Hoffman</ENAMEX> segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man That includes his companion of 15 years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johanna Lawrenson</ENAMEX> as well as his former wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anita Both</ENAMEX> women say they also find it distasteful that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> is apparently concentrating on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hoffman</ENAMEX> s problems as a manic depressive This is dangerous and misrepresents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie</ENAMEX> s life says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Lawrenson</ENAMEX> who has had an advance look at the 36 page script It s a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Hoffman</ENAMEX> says that dramatization makes the truth flexible It takes one person s account and gives it authenticity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Hoffman</ENAMEX> and his sister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hoffman</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Silvers</ENAMEX> says I wanted to be interviewed to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie</ENAMEX> s story out and maybe talking about the illness will do some good The executive producer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturday Night</ENAMEX> With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung Andrew Lack</ENAMEX> declines to discuss re creactions as a practice or his show in particular I don t talk about my work he says The president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News David W Burke</ENAMEX> didn t return numerous telephone calls One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> to comment on a work in progress such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> re creation but says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> is aware of the concerns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Lawrenson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hoffman</ENAMEX> s former wife Neither woman was invited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> to participate in a round table discussion about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hoffman</ENAMEX> that is to follow the re enactment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lieber</ENAMEX> the actor who plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hoffman</ENAMEX> says he was concerned at first that the script would misrepresent an astute political mind one that I admired but that his concerns were allayed The producers he says did a good job of depicting someone who had done so much but who was also a manic depressive
