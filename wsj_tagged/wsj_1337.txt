gains also signaled some support for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> equities They pegged the support largely to anticipation that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s current account imbalance can t be much worse than the near record deficits seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> It s a case of the market being too high to buy
