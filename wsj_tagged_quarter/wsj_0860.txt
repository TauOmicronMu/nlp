<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group Inc</ENAMEX> ordered a major pullback from program trading amid mounting pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> from some of its biggest investors Other big brokerage firms also showed signs of retreating from controversial computer assisted trading which has become a liability for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> after this month s 190 point Friday the 13th plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> Yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs Co</ENAMEX> said it will campaign for significant curbs on the most common form of program trading stock index arbitrage Also other firms including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> unit and Oppenheimer Co are debating whether to follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> s lead and pull back from program trading And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears Roebuck Co</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc</ENAMEX> unit which used to be the 10th biggest program trader on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> said it is sending a program bashing letter to more than two million clients over the next month among other actions that may include a nationwide advertising campaign Program trading is simply an idea whose time has passed said Dean Witter Chairman Philip J Purcell Program trading which last month accounted for a record 13 8 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume refers to a variety of computer assisted trading of large amounts of stocks stock index futures and options Much of the trading is geared to short term gains caused by brief price swings in volatile markets <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> pulled back briefly from program trading after the October 1987 stock crash But then it charged back in emboldened by post crash studies that exonerated program trading from causing the crash though not from causing big price swings And now it s reeling from a renewed outcry this time not only from small individual investors but from major institutions that control big trading commissions The criticism came to a head Tuesday when Kemper Corp a big insurance and financial services firm cut off four <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> firms that engage in program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer General Electric Co</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody Co Morgan Stanley Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns Co</ENAMEX> from getting any more of Kemper s stock trading business Other big investors are following Kemper s lead Yesterday another institutional investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone Group Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> mutual fund company said it will boycott firms that engage in index arbitrage The firm manages 2 5 billion in stock mutual funds These firms by using proprietary index arbitrage trading techniques have been competing with their own customers said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert H Elfner III</ENAMEX> president of Keystone Their actions can hurt long term fundamentally oriented investors and have undermined public trust in the fairness of the markets Another institutional investor Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co said it might join Kemper in avoiding program trading brokerage firms Such companies as Keystone Kemper and Penn Mutual are dependent on business from small investors who have been peppering them with complaints about program trading and have retreated from the financial markets since the 1987 crash We haven t decided to blacklist any firms But there s a chance we might said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wilson</ENAMEX> head of Penn Mutual s 100 million stock portfolio We are very upset about what has happened to the stock market Program trading is almost like sitting on a calm beach and have a tidal wave hit you Penn Mutual owns the regional brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janney Montgomery Scott Inc</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> Yesterday several officials from Janney visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> to lobby against program trading The firm s executive committee is considering drafting an anti program trading letter to its clients and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Donald B Marron Painewebber</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer said the firm decided after the close of trading yesterday that it would stop doing index arbitrage for clients It already had ceased that form of trading for its own account It seems clear to us that index arbitrage is a big contributor to the market s volatility and it s reducing confidence in the market for institutional and retail clients Mr Marron said He said index arbitrage is clearly purely a speculative hedging arbitrage strategy that is contributing to excess volatility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> the fifth biggest program trader on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> so far this year will continue to engage in other forms of program trading besides index arbitrage and indeed is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> s foremost practitioner of non arbitrage forms of program trading in terms of volume But Mr Marron said these other forms of program trading such as using computers to buy or sell a range of stocks but not stock futures help bring liquidity to the market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> which doesn t do index arbitrage for itself but does for customers is concerned about the fallout Our corporate institutional and individual clients are concerned about what they perceive to be excessive volatility said Robert E Mnuchin senior partner in charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> s equity trading We share their concern Consequently we will recommend to regulators significant curbs on electronic access for waves of stocks which add volatility to the markets He declined to comment further <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> the 11th biggest program trader also doesn t do index arbitrage for itself Yet some officials at a regular management meeting Wednesday night urged the firm s leaders to pull out of the practice completely to appease small investors The question was Do we get mileage out of not doing it for clients said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> official But so far the answer is no Oppenheimer a relatively minor program trader is also reviewing its index arbitrage operation Not only was it stung by Kemper s boycott but it suffered an approximate 2 5 million index trading loss during the Friday the 13th plunge An Oppenheimer spokesman said index chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Liptak</ENAMEX> had left the firm and wouldn t be replaced For the time being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wiess</ENAMEX> an associate of Mr Liptak s is now our index arbitrager said the spokesman The program trading debate has caused splits even within some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> brokerage firms At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> for example the firm s leaders staunchly defend its aggressive use of index arbitrage for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> s own account and for customers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is the most active index arbitrager on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> so far this year trading about two million shares a day in the strategy However <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> s 1 400 brokers aren t so sure about index arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Said Charles V Sheehan Kidder</ENAMEX> s managing director in charge of retail business To try to talk to stockbrokers about the virtues of program trading is like trying to talk about the virtues of nuclear power to the Audubon Society He conceded there is a little bit of a conflict there between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> s active program trading and its wooing of individual investors There s a similar split at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Co</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> s 3rd biggest program trading firm Although a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> spokesman stressed the firm does program trading only for clients These are our clients and we have a responsibility to them the argument doesn t go over on the firm s front lines Program trading is scaring small investors away said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Keyes</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> broker in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogden Utah</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> insists it remains sympathetic to the individual investor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richard Grasso Big Board</ENAMEX> president said it s too early to reflect on the comments made this week by Kemper and the other program bashing firms But we value our relationships with those who use the marketplace and are certainly sensitive to their needs and desires When Kemper cut off four program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> firms from getting any of the big insurance and financial company s trading business it complained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has vested interests in its big member securities firms that engage in program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher J
