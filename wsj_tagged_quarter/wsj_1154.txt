When the good fairy assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Slovakia</ENAMEX> hovered over the cradle of Edita Gruberova many years ago in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bratislava</ENAMEX> she sprinkled her with high E flats sparkling Ds clean trills and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust Maybe she could drop by at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Opera</ENAMEX> and bring along what she forgot a little charm a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> s La Traviata Ms Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well It isn t every day that we hear a Violetta who can sing the first act s high flying music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly stitched together Never once did she gasp for air or mop her brow She was as cool as a cucumber But as you may know things are not going well for Violetta There are times when she must show a little emotion She has TB after all and a weak kneed lover and though a successful courtesan she is just about overdrawn at the bank Worse her walls move all the time at least in this production Just when Ms Gruberova sat down away from her guests to cough in private her salon began sliding around the stage her country hideaway also has a very active set of drapes Hold on to those funny braids you wanted to caution her as the sets started to roll around once more This is the most moving Traviata I ve ever seen Normally Violetta can go about her business without wondering whether she is moving as gracefully as the scenery But this is a production designed and directed by Franco Zeffirelli and paid for by Sybil Harrington who has no need to count her pennies unlike Violetta down to 20 louis at the opera s end Seeing all those millions in action I was just so relieved that Ms Gruberova gawky thing that she is didn t accidentally smother herself in a drape Large and lavish Traviata is another addition to the Met s growing stock of cast proof productions mostly by Mr Zeffirelli They have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast isn t up to either If a strike ever hits the Met the company can still sell tickets to his Boheme and Turandot and boom out recordings of another era Last week s discerning audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the tenor Neil Shicoff who sang an aria inside it Inexplicably costumed as a rabbinical student tottering around on lifts Mr Shicoff hardly seemed the fellow to catch a fancy cocotte s eye I wish he could wear lifts in his voice Not nearly in his best form the tenor made dullish sounds along with his usual clumsy hand gestures Maybe Mr Z was too busy taming his set to work with his naturally ungainly Alfredo Or is it that Mr Z is getting a little tired of Traviata This is the same production already seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florence</ENAMEX> and its scenic ideas echo the movie he made with Placido Domingo and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teresa Stratas Decades</ENAMEX> earlier Maria Callas sang the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> staging that introduced the flashback idea In an invention that drives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> purists bananas Violetta lies dying in bed during the prelude rising deliriously when then she remembers the great parties she used to throw The entire opera is her dream Given the prelude s thematic connections with the music preceding the last act the idea is more worn than bad though as luck would have it for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear Carlos Kleiber trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song Once she did so the big souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging Of heart pounding moments there were nearly none and whether this has to do with Mr Kleiber or the wooden cast is hard to say In any event Ms Gruberova barely ventilated Violetta s anguish in her long meeting with Wolfgang Brendel who as Germont seemed fairly desperate trying to inject an Italianate lilt into his heavy teutonic baritone Di Provenza wasn t much of an advertisement for sunny southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> Perhaps Mr Kleiber could let him substitute one of the songs about dead children and dark nights from Mahler s Kindertotenlieder Speaking of dark nights the Met s next door neighbor the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City Opera</ENAMEX> has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians who wanted pay parity with the the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago Lyric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Opera</ENAMEX> orchestras Well they can now go and audition there Good luck Common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market The cancellation bodes poorly for a company already beset with an identity crisis exacerbated by the retirement of general director Beverly Sills and the amazing appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Keene</ENAMEX> as her successor after his years of feckless toiling in the pit As the Met discovered years ago following a belated December opening it is nearly impossible to recapture subscribers once they have had time to ponder their entertainment choices I for instance was perfectly happy at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avery Fisher Hall</ENAMEX> the other day listening to Helmuth Rilling conduct the Messa per Rossini a strange piece written by 13 different Italian composers to honor Rossini after his death in 1868 Each of them contributed a section at the behest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements For all that the piece landed unperformed in a dusty archive after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX> refused to supply a chorus and orchestra We know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX> s own contribution was mighty impressive since the operatic Libera me was reworked for the Manzoni Requiem of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson The surprising discovery of the evening at Fisher was the high standard achieved by some of his now obscure colleagues notably Raimondo Boucheron His melodious Confutatis was smoothly sung by bass <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Matthews</ENAMEX> Also Teodulo Mabellini s Lux aeterna was intriguingly scored and splendidly put across by Mr Rilling He brought along his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuttgart</ENAMEX> based Gaechinger Kantorei chorus and even better the Czech soprano Gabriela Benackova She was in her most radiant expressive voice Maybe she could step across the plaza to the Met where she has still to make her debut and help out her Czech compatriot by singing the slow parts of Traviata The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo International Film Festival</ENAMEX> was no match for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannes Film Festival</ENAMEX> in terms of prestige but it made its mark It awarded the largest cash prize of any film festival to young and first time film makers At this year s event the third since the festival got under way in 1985 Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso won the Sakura Gold prize of 143 000 for Yaaba Old Woman By comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cannes</ENAMEX> now gives 39 000 to the winner of its young director s award Says director <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">George Miller Mad Max</ENAMEX> I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the recognition There are drawbacks Vincent Tolentino a correspondent for the French magazine Telerama says of the recently ended <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> festival No one makes deals and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy shares or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs about 2 60 for each transaction bringing the total fee to 200 francs While no figures exist it is thought that many small investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> store securities privately in some cases to avoid paying high inheritance taxes The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is considering giving aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> to support their recent political reforms a

Eastern European countries the spokesman said He said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western

toilet not only tests blood pressure pulse and urine it also stores the data for up to 130 days Nippon Telegraph Telephone Corp and Omron Tateisi Electronics are involved with Toto s new product which will go on the market in about two years time It will be very expensive the spokesman warned The price can not be less than 7 000 Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> took office last December special agents have arrested more than 6 000 federal employees on charges ranging from extortion to tax evasion Hector Castaneda Jimenez chief prosecutor at the Attorney General s Office said that an estimated 82 8 million in government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the campaign to root out official corruption Mr Castaneda s office will reportedly issue warrants during the next six months for the arrest of another 10 000 federal employees Those employees are suspected of illegally gaining an estimated 376 8 million the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the Excelsior news service He added that federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount The rest will probably not be recoverable either because the statute of limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time in jail rather than return the money the prosecutor said The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> which is
