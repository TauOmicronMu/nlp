<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco D S Inc</ENAMEX> the drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy court protection last year received a 925 million offer from a group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> billionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Bass Revco</ENAMEX> reacted cautiously saying the plan would add 260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company It was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> s huge debt from its 1 3 billion leveraged buy out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankruptcy Code Revco</ENAMEX> insists that the proposal is simply an expression of interest because under Chapter 11 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> has exclusivity rights until Feb 28 Those rights prevent anyone other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> from proposing a reorganization plan Also under Chapter 11 a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders banks and other creditors A financial adviser for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> bondholders <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Schulte</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chilmark Partners</ENAMEX> had mixed reactions to the offer He said he feared a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> reorganization might force bondholders to accept a cheap deal and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> group s offer would give them more money However the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only 260 5 million and no equity The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> bonds are high yield high risk junk bonds holders have 750 million in claims against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco Mr Schulte</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> received the offer Oct 20 but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia Partners Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth Texas</ENAMEX> partnership that includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M Bass Group</ENAMEX> made the proposal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bass</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> Analysts said the nation s second largest drugstore chain was a valuable company despite its financial woes Its problem they say is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy out and the current 515 million debt load is keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> in the red If bought at the right price it could still be profitable said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Stein</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mcdonald Co Cleveland</ENAMEX> In addition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> s 1 900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate he said and demographics are helping pharmacies The nation s aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> s parent company Anac Holding Corp said the company reported a loss of 16 2 million for the fiscal first quarter compared with a loss of 27 9 million in the year earlier quarter Sales were 597 8 million up 2 4 from the previous year The company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Twinsburg Ohio</ENAMEX> said its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51 to 9 2 million from 6 1 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia Partners</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bass Group</ENAMEX> declined to comment The partnership also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co Equitable Life Assurance Society</ENAMEX> of the U S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> The offer consists of 410 5 million in cash and the rest in notes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia</ENAMEX> would sell up to 10 of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> s chairman and chief executive officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boake A Sells</ENAMEX> said both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans but little progress has been made since negotiations began this summer He said he has not met with representatives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia Any</ENAMEX> reorganization proposal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sells</ENAMEX> said is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company bondholders banks and other creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> has 1 5 billion in claims outstanding It s not like the board can decide by itself <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sells</ENAMEX> said adding we re indifferent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> plan We just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Schulte</ENAMEX> the bondholders adviser said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal They want to pretend it doesn t exist he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Schulte</ENAMEX> who met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia</ENAMEX> representatives on Oct 10 said It s certainly a responsible offer It s not an effort to steal the company in the middle of the night
