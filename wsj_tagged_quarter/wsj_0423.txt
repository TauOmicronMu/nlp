Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">State Baker</ENAMEX> we read decided to kill a speech that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gates</ENAMEX> deputy national security adviser and a career <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX> expert was going to give to a student colloquium the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Collegiate Security Conference</ENAMEX> We keep wondering what Mr Gates wanted to say Perhaps he might have cited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s need for a stable currency free and competitive markets private property and real prices and other pie in the sky reforms Perhaps he d have called for a decentralized political and economic system without a dominant communist party Or political arrangements to alleviate the grievances and demands of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX> ethnic minorities and republics Why a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Gates</ENAMEX> might even have said Nor are Soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant Western credits If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gates</ENAMEX> had been allowed to say these things we would now be hearing about discord and disarray on foreign policy Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> would fail just as they were when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vice President Quayle</ENAMEX> voiced similar sentiments It s somehow OK for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Secretary Baker</ENAMEX> himself however to say all the same things In fact he did the quotes above are from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> s speech of two weeks ago So far as we can see there is no disagreement among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker Mr Quayle</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gates</ENAMEX> we ve read or for that matter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> They all understand point one Nothing the U S can do will make much difference in whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> succeeds with perestroika Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gates</ENAMEX> would emphasize more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> the many hurdles the Soviet leader must leap if he is going to succeed But everyone agrees that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s problems result from the failure of his own system They can be relieved only by changing that system not by pouring Western money into it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> membership will not matter to Donbas coal miners short of soap nor will a START treaty make any difference to Ukrainian nationalists On the other hand so long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is easing his grip on his empire everyone we ve heard agrees that the U S can benefit by engaging him If a deal can be made to cut the world s Ortegas loose from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> why not We don t expect much good from nuclear arms control but conventional arms talks might demilitarize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> There s nothing in the least contradictory in all this and it would be nice to think that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated complex view Yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration for not helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> So every time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> official raises a doubt about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> community shouts Cold War and timidity and an administration spokesman is quickly trotted out to reply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> wants perestroika to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> seems especially sensitive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> ailment known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX> itis Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism and fainting spells when someone writes the word controversy As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Times Baker</ENAMEX> just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press In short the problem is not intra administration disagreement but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail and its political opponents will ask Who lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev Mr Baker</ENAMEX> may want to avoid criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell</ENAMEX> but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World not just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> In any case he s likely to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues the more leaks will pop up all around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> a lesson once learned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX> Letting officials express their own nuances can be educational We note that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Secretary Cheney</ENAMEX> said that European euphoria over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is starting to be tempered by a recognition of the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with It is in the Western interest to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> succeed The odds are against him as he himself would no doubt tell you The ultimate outcome depends on what he does not on what we do Even if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret these are not very complicated thoughts Surely there is someone in the administration maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Gates</ENAMEX> who could explain them to college students or even schoolchildren
