TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> shall before it becomes a Law be presented to the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> States If he approve he shall sign it but if not he shall return it with his Objections to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> in which it shall have originated who shall enter the Objections at large on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> and proceed to reconsider it If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> shall agree to pass the Bill it shall be sent together with the Objections to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> by which it shall likewise be reconsidered and if approved by two thirds of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> it shall become a Law ARTICLE I SECTION 7 CLAUSE 3 Every Order Resolution or Vote to which the Concurrence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Representatives may be necessary except on a question of Adjournment shall be presented to the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> States and before the Same shall take Effect shall be approved by him or being disapproved by him shall be repassed by two thirds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Representatives according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill President Bush</ENAMEX> told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line item veto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vice President Quayle</ENAMEX> and Budget Director Darman said recently they ve joined the search On Tuesday the subject came up again when Marlin Fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> press corps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> doesn t have any provision in mind but line item veto bait will be like earthworms at midnight in the coming Continuing Resolution The harder question is whether anyone yet understands that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> s fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law We have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line item veto since 1987 when lawyer Stephen Glazier first made the case on this page The 1974 budget reform passed over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Nixon</ENAMEX> s veto took away the presidential impoundment power thereby introducing monstrous Crs and eviscerating the presidential veto Mr Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> might take the President out of the loop Article I Section 7 Clause 3 says that whether it s called an order resolution or vote or anything else Presidents must have the chance to veto Labeling an omnibus budget a bill can t deprive the President of his power to veto items Finding a test case shouldn t be hard but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> had the perfect case but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> blinked before it could go to court After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> and S L stories broke some Congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble They worried about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior Department</ENAMEX> directive to log all communications with Members or their staffs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> inserted the following into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX> appropriation None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX> and Members and committees of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and their staff The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power When it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line item veto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> caved The fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has of any line item veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year This section shall be effective only on Oct 1 1989 This means Interior contacts can not be logged only on one day a Sunday that had already passed If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is looking for another unconstitutional bill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep John Dingell</ENAMEX> is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Reagan</ENAMEX> vetoed this as a First Amendment violation The Fairness Doctrine s enthusiasts are incumbents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> who know the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts deterring feisty challengers There are also other provisions requiring Congressmen to join treaty negotiating teams and new restrictions on OMB Unconstitutional bills make good legal targets but the line item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers Commenting on the budget mess this week <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> said The perception out there is that it s the fault of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people Exactly right Now s the time to make the political case that Presidents need the line item weapon to restore discipline to the budget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is in no position to naysay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> now that we re into Gramm Rudman s sequestration Just this week the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Senate</ENAMEX> conference met 231 conferees divided into 26 different subconferences <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senator Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> agreed to close some bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> in exchange for such goodies as 11 million for a parking lot at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walter Reed Hospital Conference</ENAMEX> negotiator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Bill Hefner</ENAMEX> pulled down 40 million in military bases for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and graciously allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senator James Sasser</ENAMEX> 70 million for bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tennessee President Bush</ENAMEX> should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> may have lost any sense of discipline but that doesn t mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> has the power to change how <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> works if only he will use it
