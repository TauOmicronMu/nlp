It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world s environmental problems Is Science or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Private Gain Driving</ENAMEX> Ozone Policy by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Melloan Business World Oct</ENAMEX> 24 To suggest that a 10 drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted Consider the fact that a mere 2 drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny wise and pound foolish The reason environmentalists don t mind seeing new crises arise is because there are new crises Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago If you are doubtful consider for a moment that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pomton Lakes Reservoirs</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> which supply the tristate area with drinking water are riddled with toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pcbs</ENAMEX> This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group s ploy to create a market It s time business leaders and the general public learn that mankind does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral symbiotic player within nature s workings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark T Kuiper Jersey City N J Mr Melloan</ENAMEX> s column was right on the money but I wish it could have gone one step further As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland Molina theory named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth s atmosphere and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal Protocol</ENAMEX> An important part of my effort has been to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design In my research I have found a paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Scotto</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> and several colleagues reporting an 11 year decrease in UV B radiation at eight U S measurement sites Our concern for the ozone layer of course grows out of the potential for increasing UV B radiation which could damage flora and fauna The last of the measurements reported was in 1985 but recent conversations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Scotto</ENAMEX> indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend I understand but haven t yet verified that there are studies by Norwegians Russians and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Max Planck Institute</ENAMEX> that show either unchanging or declining UV B at the surface To me this calls into question the validity of the Rowland Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort This in turn threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Resource Development Commission</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency Friends</ENAMEX> of the Earth etc were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV B study I was urged to get back to the agenda topic which was ironically a schedule for getting rid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hcfcs</ENAMEX> the so called soft Cfcs that are such an important part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFC</ENAMEX> substitution scenario <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subsequently</ENAMEX> I have learned that a private group of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> is a part is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scotto</ENAMEX> report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments But this is almost an underground activity To my knowledge no government entities including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> are pursuing UV B measurements The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion establishment meetings of which I have attended many It seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by Cfcs While recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened I intend to urge that UV B be monitored whenever I can Frederick H Hallett Vice President Industry and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Government Relations White Consolidated</ENAMEX> Industries <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inc Washington</ENAMEX> The relationship between surface release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cfcs</ENAMEX> and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974 Although like all scientific theories it had its initial opponents few experts question the connection now The discovery of the ozone hole over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> and the results of ground based and high altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFC</ENAMEX> concentrations In the September issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scientific American Thomas E Graedel</ENAMEX> distinguished member of the technical staff at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT T

<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mainz West Germany</ENAMEX> wrote It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFC</ENAMEX> 11 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFC</ENAMEX> 12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Melloan</ENAMEX> quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Teagan</ENAMEX> and invokes the

are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Teagan</ENAMEX> has no special expertise in the area He is a mechanical engineer not an atmospheric chemist It is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts and that environmental groups need them to stay in business Solving the global environmental
