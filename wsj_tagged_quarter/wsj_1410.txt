<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co</ENAMEX> and Saab Scania AB of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX> broke off talks about a possible alliance after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab s car operations would outweigh the likely return With the collapse of the talks Friday European analysts expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> which is scrambling to fend off a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> s archrival General Motors Corp Saab meanwhile is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business Saab said last week it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers Among the possible suitors is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S</ENAMEX> p A analysts said last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and Saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long term business sense to both parties Individuals close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> side of the negotiations said late last week that the No 2 U S auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker s automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the European and U S luxury car markets In addition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently didn t go far Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab s highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials became convinced they couldn t expect to recover the investment it would require to make Saab s cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market Saab s problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1 2 billion kronor 186 1 million loss during the first eight months of this year slightly worse than Saab Scania had forecast in its first half report last month Overall Saab Scania s pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48 9 to 1 billion Swedish kronor 155 1 million from 1 96 billion kronor 303 9 million a year earlier Industry analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> said the most likely suitor for Saab now is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat Saab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> have worked together in the past in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of Saab s 9000 model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> s Croma and Lancia s Thema Last month Saab Scania Chief Executive Georg Karnsund said his company has had talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> about a broader alliance But the talks yielded nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it he said As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> analysts expect the end of the Saab play will allow the U S auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> for a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> The failure of the Saab talks makes it even more crucial for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to be victorious in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> contest said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Reitman</ENAMEX> European auto industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBS Phillips Drew</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London Ford</ENAMEX> faces an uphill fight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> however <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> wrapped up by the end of the month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> meanwhile is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker s headquarter operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detroit A GM</ENAMEX> spokesman said the visit isn t connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> situation But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> clearly views <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> as a prize worth fighting for since the company s gilded brand image would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the U S Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U S luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four year old effort to market its German built Scorpio sedan in the U S as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name So despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM Jaguar</ENAMEX> romance analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> by last Friday had boosted its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> holding to about 11 of the luxury auto maker s shares outstanding from 10 4 early last week About 5 4 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares changed hands in active trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> s stock exchange Friday and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence 11 On the U S over the counter market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> s American depositary receipts rose 12 5 cents to 11 125 Joann S Lublin contributed to this article
