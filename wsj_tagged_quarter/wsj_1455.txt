Sitting at the bar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four Seasons</ENAMEX> restaurant architect William Mcdonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts Look how much air is moving around he says The ventilation here is great You may be hearing more about the 38 year old Mr Mcdonough and his preoccupation with clean air After years of relative obscurity he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture Mr Mcdonough believes that the well being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues and avoiding mahogany which comes from endangered rain forests He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four star Quilted Giraffe restaurant architecturally impeccable Progressive Architecture magazine called it and his remodeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison Avenue</ENAMEX> clothing store He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space He is now designing a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts What really stirs his muse though is aerobic architecture Now the question is Is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> ready for it Mr Mcdonough is about to tackle his biggest clean air challenge yet the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw Trade Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> the first such center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> The project has already acquired a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> cachet Bloomingdale s plans to sell a foot tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX> s in December If Mr Mcdonough s plans get executed as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum steel and glass recycled from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX> s abundant rubble A 20 story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space Solar powered batteries will make the spire glow The windows will open The carpets won t be glued down and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes To the extent that the 150 million budget will allow it Mr Mcdonough will rely on solid wood rather than plywood or particle board to limit the emission of formaldehyde If Mr Mcdonough has his way the Poles will compensate for the trade center s emissions of carbon dioxide a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear The Poles would plant a 10 square mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of 150 000 with the center s developer footing the bill The news hasn t exactly moved others in Mr Mcdonough s profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work says John Burgee whose <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm is designing the redevelopment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Square</ENAMEX> but we can t all carry it to that extreme Karen Nichols senior associate at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Graves</ENAMEX> s architecture firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton N J</ENAMEX> says We re really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily Mr Mcdonough responds I m asking people to broaden their agendas The son of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> s executive who was stationed in many countries around the world Mr Mcdonough was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and attended 19 schools in places ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shaker Heights Ohio</ENAMEX> before entering Dartmouth College He earned a master s degree in architecture from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth He and his father still spend time each summer fly fishing for salmon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iceland Living</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> he says made him sensitive to the limits on food power and water supplies At his first school in the U S he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont</ENAMEX> At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland Mr Mcdonough</ENAMEX> s first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Defense Fund</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> The offices took 10 000 square feet of a building with 14 foot ceilings and big operable windows Since the 1970s energy crisis some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect high indoor pollution To reduce it at the fund s building workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director s office Jute rather than a synthetic material lies under the tacked down carpets and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic The budget was only 400 000 Athens with Spartan means Mr Mcdonough says The fund s lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees Economists and administrators sit along a boulevard with street lamps and ficus trees In offices triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight Offices with outside windows have inside windows too to let in more real daylight We proved a healthy office doesn t cost more says Frederic Krupp executive director of the fund It really looks beautiful and is very light says Ann Hornaday a free lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings But she says I guess I didn t really notice the trees Maybe they were hidden by all the people Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> renovation reflects much of Mr Mcdonough s environmental concern The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling crystalline geode It makes extensive use of stainless steel silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc strip floors To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> however Mr Mcdonough and friends planted 1 000 acorns around the country The ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX> project still awaits approval by city officials Its developer is a Polish American Sasha Muniak He had worked with Mr Mcdonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment not readily accessible in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> now for a growing number of Westerners doing business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe Mr Mcdonough</ENAMEX> thinks of the center as the Eiffel Tower of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX> and a symbol of the resurgence of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture it is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland Jessica Mathews</ENAMEX> vice president of World Resources Institute in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington D C</ENAMEX> says that perhaps a quarter of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> s soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle Ages</ENAMEX> The future of the forest remains uncertain Mr Muniak s company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balag Ltd</ENAMEX> has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained After all Mr Muniak says in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> there aren t too many people worried about the environment They re more worried about bread on the table
