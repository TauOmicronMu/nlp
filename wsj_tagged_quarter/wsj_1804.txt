Whitbread Co put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company s brands Whitbread already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said Analysts expect the spirits operations and some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about 500 million 788 8 million Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin the No 2 imported gin in the U S and Laphroaig single malt whiskey Also for sale are Buckingham Wile Co which distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U S and Whitbread s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlas Peak Vineyards</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley Beefeater</ENAMEX> alone is worth as much as 300 million analysts said Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for 174 5 million That purchase represented an attempt by Whitbread a venerable British brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry Now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations For rival liquor companies the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands It s not very often something like this comes up said Ron Littleboy a liquor company analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> The division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted Neill Junor an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> brokers County Natwest Woodmac Among possible buyers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX> might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio Grand Met owns <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bombay</ENAMEX> gin the No 3 imported gin in the U S rival Guinness PLC has the No 1 imported brand Tanqueray The Whitbread spirits auction is an extremely interesting development and naturally we ll be considering it carefully a Grand Met spokesman said Guinness which owns several leading whiskey brands plus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX> s gin the world s No 1 gin is considered less likely to bid for the Whitbread spirits A Guinness spokesman declined to comment Two other global liquor giants <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s Allied Lyons PLC also are possible buyers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> s gin is the world s No 2 gin brand but the company doesn t own any of the major gin brands imported in the U S Allied Lyons while powerful in whiskey doesn t own any major white spirit brands We will certainly have to take a look at the Whitbread spirits business an Allied Lyons spokesman said We would certainly like to have a major white spirits brand in our portfolio A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> wouldn t comment Smaller liquor companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown Forman Corp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands Inc</ENAMEX> of the U S also are likely to be interested Such companies are increasingly being left behind in the global liquor business says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> s Mr Littleboy In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> wouldn t comment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown Forman</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville Ky</ENAMEX> distiller also declined to comment Whitbread s wine spirits and soft drink operations had trading profit of 35 4 million on sales of 315 5 million in the year ended Feb 25 The company which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft drink interests didn t break out results for the businesses it plans to sell But analysts estimate their trading profit at 30 million Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb 25 of 223 2 million on sales of 2 26 billion Whitbread s spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry Earlier this year the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry British brewers currently own thousands of pubs which in turn sell only the breweries beer and soft drinks Under new rules many of the country s pubs would become free houses selling beers of their choice Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses The company which last month paid 50 7 million for regional British brewer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boddington Group PLC</ENAMEX> has about 13 of the British beer market Whitbread also owns the license to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> In addition Whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel liquor store and restaurant businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Inc</ENAMEX> of the country s Pizza Hut chain In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and the U S Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants Focusing on beer restaurants and hotels means we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Jarvis Whitbread</ENAMEX> s managing director said in a statement The spirits business would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players Whitbread also announced that Mr Jarvis who is 48 will become the company s chief executive March 1 At that time Sam Whitbread the company s chairman and a descendant of its 18th century founder will retire from executive duties He will retain the honorary title of non executive
