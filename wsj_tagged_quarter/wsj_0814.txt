managing director of the international division at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi Ltd</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s leading department stores Japanese retail executives say the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the U S is that unlike manufacturing retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the U S market and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home won t translate into success in the U S Japanese department

Allen</ENAMEX> however doesn t think that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is about to embark on a major buying binge Nonetheless speculation heated up yesterday when <ENAMEX

about buying Bloomingdale s Tokyu however said no agreement had been reached Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in Bloomingdale s which bankers in <ENAMEX

Japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the U S retailing industry isn t likely to be so easy analysts say Up until now most stores have followed the same basic overseas strategy First they set up overseas merchandising offices to import items and track new fashion trends Then they opened small gift shops mostly aimed at Japanese tourists Reluctant to advance further on their own
