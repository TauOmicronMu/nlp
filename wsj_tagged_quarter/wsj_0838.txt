When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors Co</ENAMEX> announced the appointment of William Coors as president late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wednesday Peter Coors</ENAMEX> wasn t promoted at least not officially But the announcement by the big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Golden Colo</ENAMEX> brewer was an implicit statement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Coor</ENAMEX> s rising role at the company analysts say It also underscores the difficult task ahead as Coors attempts to purchase Stroh Brewery Co and fight off increasingly tough competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anheuser Busch Cos</ENAMEX> The latest management shuffling at Coors seemed to focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Coors</ENAMEX> who will relinquish the president s post to his uncle William who is 73 The elder Coors has been chairman since 1970 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey</ENAMEX> who at 44 is one year older than his brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> will head up Coors Technology Co a small unit he has run for several years But Coors insists the administrative changes won t really shift responsibilities at the company Indeed a spokesman for Coors said that since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">January Peter</ENAMEX> has been reporting directly to William rather than to his brother The change in titles makes the structure conform to the reality the spokesman said William the brothers another brother Joe Jr and their father Joseph Sr all serve on the company s nine member board According to analysts the changes reflect the tough task the company faces in integrating the operations and marketing efforts of Stroh and Coors steering the merger through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and continuing to fight the battle Coors is waging with Anheuser and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller Brewing Co</ENAMEX> a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos</ENAMEX> It s gray beard time said Tom Pirko president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bevmark Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> consulting firm referring to the move of William into the presidency This is a time of tremendous risk at the company and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> has a tremendous amount of responsibility Putting William at the helm probably won t increase the elder Coors s imput into the beer business but it doesn t hurt to have a senior statesman at the top he said In a brief telephone interview yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Coors</ENAMEX> said his uncle is our leader We depend on all his years of experience and knowledge in the industry and that doesn t change But in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">January Peter</ENAMEX> said his uncle told him and his brothers You guys run those units Coors stressed that the removal of Jeff from the presidency wasn t a demotion but would allow him to devote his full attention to his unit Coors has continually pointed to the importance of the technology unit to its diversification efforts But overall Coors s success or lack thereof depends on the beer business said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emanuel Goldman</ENAMEX> analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Mr Goldman</ENAMEX> credits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Coors</ENAMEX> with pulling Coors s marketing efforts into the 20th century by pushing for intensified marketing efforts modern advertising campaigns and significantly higher marketing expenditures Analysts also credit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> with selling other family members on the purchase of Stroh a transaction that will cost about 425 million and slap a big piece of debt on Coors s books for the first time in the company s history <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> had a major struggle in getting this done said Mr Pirko Taking on debt was controversial within the family Mr Pirko added but in the end <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> called the shots In yesterday s interview however <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> declined to take individual credit for the moves We manage as a team here he said The team establishes the goals It s the result that s important not who s the architect or the driving force And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> will continue to be under the gun given the dominance of Anheuser the stubbornly flat beer market of the past decade and recent Coors financial results that have been frustratingly mediocre So far this year Coors market share has been slipping and so has net income due to increased costs and increased price competition the company said Price competition is about to become even more fierce Anheuser announced on Wednesday that it would begin discounting Budweiser its flagship brand which analysts say will put exceptionally heavy pressure on Coors management in the midst of a major merger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Coors</ENAMEX> however said the discounting by Anheuser could also mean that Coors increased marketing efforts are having an impact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX> he said I don t know how the industry can get too much tougher This is just a signal that the toughness is going to continue
