Doesn t anybody here want to win this mayor s race As they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Democrat David Dinkins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Republican Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> are in trouble <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20 point lead in most of the public opinion polls But in the past 10 days he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> s first black mayor Ordinarily a clever opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side s misfortunes But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> a celebrated prosecutor has had difficulty switching from his crime busting finger pointing mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big troubled city And now at the crucial moment he s running out of money This is the nation s biggest city and traditionally its mayor is the nation s best known urban politician Democrats hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> could become a highly visible national leader Republicans figured that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> the nation s best known prosecutor they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star But it hasn t worked out that way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> is a decent but sloppy guy says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Garth</ENAMEX> veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Edward Koch</ENAMEX> defeated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> in the Sept 12 Democratic primary The alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> is ghastly I guess we ll reluctantly go ahead and do it vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wade</ENAMEX> a politically active professor who supported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ravitch</ENAMEX> an also ran in the Democratic primary There s nothing on the other side We re picking up steam insists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ailes Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> s media consultant whose last big campaign helped put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> He adds It just hasn t gotten down to the engine room yet But the steam may never reach the engine room For just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> latches on to an issue that has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> reeling his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr Ailes s commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday To help out this week the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> members <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp Transportation</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> Powers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> campaign manager For Republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes all of this is deeply frustrating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Historically New York</ENAMEX> is almost always in trouble But the trouble it faces now under Democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past This year the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year And hardly surprising many residents trying to cope with the city s other problems are constantly on edge one ethnic group scrapping with another <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">People</ENAMEX> weren t so happy in the 1930s says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Lessner</ENAMEX> another local professor and the biographer of the legendary Fiorello Laguardia the city s fusion mayor who built a coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> hopes to emulate But at least back then they didn t generally direct their anger at each other The 62 year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> an ex Marine has served as the city clerk and as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president a job with limited executive responsibilities I I defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> He defeated the contentious Mr Koch in the Democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city s racial and ethnic wounds His general election campaign is almost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> like all muted pictures and comforting words His theme is unity decency humanity bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> together again Both candidates are negotiating about holding debates but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them The 45 year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> He s got to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> s negatives up says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Miringoff</ENAMEX> director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion But our polls show voters don t like the attack stuff Why even 20 of the Republican vote is going to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> It s assault weapons politics says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Siegal Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s issues director insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> effort For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> forces it s a conundrum On the one hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> wants to cut into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s credibility On the other he seeks to convince voters he s the new Fiorello Laguardia affable good natured and ready to lead <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> out of the mess it s in It hasn t helped that he s waffled on abortion and gay rights sought the support of both the Liberal and Conservative parties he won the Liberal endorsement and that he turned to comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> for help with Jewish voters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mason</ENAMEX> left the campaign after telling reporters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> is a fancy shvartzer with a moustache Shvartzer is a derogatory Yiddish word for a black person <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble He can match <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Mason</ENAMEX> with his own Robert Sonny Carson an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> campaign paid Mr Carson close to 10 000 to get out the vote on primary election day Paper work on how it was spent is incomplete Mr Carson has been charged with being anti Semitic Asked about that the other day he replied Anti Semitic I m anti white More troubling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> is his record in personal accounting It began in 1973 when he was being considered for deputy mayor and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he hadn t paid his income tax for the previous four years I was always going to do it tomorrow he explained at the time And now he s busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner City Broadcasting Co</ENAMEX> headed by his old friend and patron Percy Sutton to his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins Jr</ENAMEX> for 58 000 He had valued the shares at more than 1 million two years earlier He says he sold the stock to avoid conflict of interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s Board</ENAMEX> of Estimate He says his son hasn t paid for the shares It looks like serious tax evasion says Mr Ailes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> media consultant It follows the same pattern as his tax returns He waits to talk about it until after he gets caught He simply hasn t explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth 58 000 two years later says Mr Powers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> campaign manager It s ludicrous for him to suggest it s the difference between the breakup value of the shares and their market value So far though no one not even former U S attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> has broken or just what tax he has evaded The crime goes to character says Ron Maiorana a consultant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> campaign It s serious stuff He evades and ducks He s had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter It makes people think maybe this guy isn t so squeaky clean after all says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Garth Mayor Koch</ENAMEX> s media consultant The result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think
