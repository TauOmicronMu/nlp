Troubled Saatchi Saatchi Co has attracted offers for some of its advertising units with potential suitors including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group</ENAMEX> but has rejected them people familiar with the company said Industry executives said Interpublic approached Saatchi in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> about buying its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun Esty</ENAMEX> unit but was turned down by Chairman Maurice Saatchi More recently Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi s smaller communications companies identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives but again was rebuffed they said Interpublic s chairman and chief executive officer Philip Geier Jr made the pitches in visits to Mr Saatchi in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> the executives said A Saatchi spokesman declined to comment about Interpublic But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun</ENAMEX> and Rowland units He added We have no intention of selling either business Interpublic declined comment The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19 year history Takeover speculation has been rife its consulting business is on the block and its largest shareholder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Asset Management</ENAMEX> has said it s been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company and their outlook at least for the short term is bleak In the midst of the current turmoil Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses It named a new chief executive officer former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMS International</ENAMEX> head Robert Louis Dreyfus It rebuffed an offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel</ENAMEX> head of Saatchi s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> unit to lead a management buy out of all or part of Saatchi And last week people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> would lead a buy out if a hostile bid emerged But Saatchi s troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses While Saatchi s major agency networks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> and Saatchi Saatchi Advertising would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts its smaller businesses are quite attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun Esty</ENAMEX> for example has had big problems at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office but offers strong offices in other areas of the country including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago That</ENAMEX> would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> presence While there would be some client conflicts they wouldn t be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi s other agencies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun</ENAMEX> also would be a sizable addition to an agency network It has billings of about 850 million and blue chip clients including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">General Mills Jeep Eagle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Brands Rowland</ENAMEX> meanwhile has expanded aggressively and now ranks as the fifth largest U S public relations firm according to O Dwyer s Directory of Public Relations Firms It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own Other Saatchi units include ad agency Mccaffrey Mccall which has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> account and which has been attempting to buy itself back and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Marlboro</ENAMEX> a sports and event marketing firm Despite Saatchi s firm stand against selling its ad units U S analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units Mr Louis Dreyfus in a recent interview said he might sell a marginal agency or office Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non advertising businesses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Final Four Prudential Insurance Co</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> said it selected four agencies to pitch

account in 1981 released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident The memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency which pleaded innocent to the charges Among other things the memo contends that Young Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation wouldn t uncover any information that would embarrass the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaica Tourist Board</ENAMEX> It also contends that Young Rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures a Jamaican firm hired by the agency The U S indictment charges Ad Ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then minister of tourism The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its
