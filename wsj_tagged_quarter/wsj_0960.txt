The recent bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> Airlines have led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> is scheduled to vote today on an anti airline takeover bill that would block for up to 50 days any bid for 15 or more of a U S airline even a straight cash purchase Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner who earlier fueled the anti takeover fires with his quasi xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U S carriers now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Rep Steve Bartlett</ENAMEX> who has 40 000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> Airlines workers in his district says the bill is good politics but bad law It is ironic that at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> s partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> so many in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> favor an incumbent protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline Aeroflot
