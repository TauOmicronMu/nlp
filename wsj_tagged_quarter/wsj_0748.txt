When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> travels to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> today he ll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels But the two day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration s policies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> Some conservatives say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> shouldn t make the trip during which he will participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> s celebration of 100 years of democracy These critics object to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> s participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> among the guests In addition they argue he won t help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> s standing in the region by trumpeting the U S commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> says Curtin Windsor who served as U S ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration Mr Windsor among other analysts connected to the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX> fears the gathering of 18 leaders mostly from Central American nations will force <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> to explain and redeem himself in the wake of charges that the U S failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> At the same time liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> s joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in U S aid to the tiny country The administration proposed only 57 million in so called economic support funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> this year down from the 90 million the U S provided last year The administration said improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> s economic condition warrant the cut in aid which the country uses mainly to make payments on its 4 5 billion foreign debt But Costa Rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices combined with the country s continuing struggle to reinvigorate its economy make the support as necessary as ever We are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side said Rodrigo Sotela an economic affairs specialist at the Costa Rican Embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Democrats</ENAMEX> argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> deserves more assistance for the same reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> is attending the celebration this weekend to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> However peace efforts by Costa Rican <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Oscar Arias</ENAMEX> haven t always helped the country s cause in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Mr Arias</ENAMEX> s long time refusal to support the U S s campaign against leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> earned him the ire of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan White House</ENAMEX> And more recently he insisted on signing a five nation agreement intended to disarm <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> s U S backed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> rebels faster than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration would prefer I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> s going there is a helpful sign said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sen Terry Sanford D N C</ENAMEX> a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> who pushed to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> about the same amount of aid as it received last year Lawmakers in both houses support the higher level Administration officials defend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> s decision to make the trip While they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> they insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> won t be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition renewing the U S trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region Officials also insist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">State James Baker</ENAMEX> told reporters Wednesday There won t be any formal resolutions or communiques I don t think But we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many many very important issues
