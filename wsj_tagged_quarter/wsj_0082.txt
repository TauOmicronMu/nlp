Criticism in the U S over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries relations Officials from both nations say the U S public s skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> Not that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> disagree on the Japanese acquisitions indeed each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U S Where they disagree is on the subject of U S direct investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> The U S wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> denies there are real barriers The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U S is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate even though it s only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks known as the Structural Impediments Initiative The Japanese should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Dallara U S</ENAMEX> assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary who has been in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders We have a long history of maintaining an open direct investment policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dallara</ENAMEX> says U S investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> The Japanese fret openly about the U S public s rancor One clear sign of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s nervousness came this week when a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> devoted nearly all of a regular half hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U S We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests in the U S to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people said the spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taizo Watanabe</ENAMEX> At the same time though he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries notably <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> are acquiring more American assets Fears that Japanese investors are buying up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> have escalated sharply in the past several weeks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp</ENAMEX> s purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> from Coca Cola Co and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Estate Co</ENAMEX> s acquisition of a 51 holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> the owner of some of midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> s most exclusive real estate Even before those moves added fuel the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> of one U S investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T Boone Pickens Jr</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> oilman has acquired a 26 2 stake valued at more than 1 2 billion in an automotive lighting company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito Manufacturing Co</ENAMEX> But he has failed to gain any influence at the company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> has refused to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pickens</ENAMEX> seats on its board asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> s other shareholders into buying him out at a profit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pickens</ENAMEX> made considerable political hay with his troubles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> chaired by a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texan Democratic Sen Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> last month urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S Trade Representative Carla Hills</ENAMEX> to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pickens</ENAMEX> s experience in talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dallara</ENAMEX> and Japanese officials say the question of investors access to the U S and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public s attention a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week s talks Among them are differences in savings and investment rates corporate structures and management and government spending Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other The U S says it is anxious for results We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we ve identified and we need it by next spring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dallara</ENAMEX> says Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed But they haven t clarified what those might be After the first set of meetings two months ago some U S officials complained that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> hadn t come up with specific changes it was prepared to make The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions Just to say the distribution system is wrong doesn t mean anything says a Ministry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Trade</ENAMEX> and Industry official We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time the Japanese say no matter how badly the U S wants quick results For instance at the first meeting the two sides couldn t even agree on basic data used in price discussions Since then a team of about 15 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Commerce Department</ENAMEX> officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices By Monday they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust Little by little there is progress says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITI</ENAMEX> official Both sides are taking action <ENAMEX
