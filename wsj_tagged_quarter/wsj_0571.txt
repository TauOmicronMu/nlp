Last week the British displayed unusual political immaturity The Chancellor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exchequer Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> resigned because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prime Minister Thatcher</ENAMEX> would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters The opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX> leader Neil Kinnock in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class denounced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> The British press making a mountain out of a molehill precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> and his European minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark Sir Alan considers this an ill advised and costly policy As there is an effort to anchor the dollar either to gold or other currencies the dispute is worth examining Until his resignation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> cut the top tax rate to 40 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark As a result he reignited the inflation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> through a long and costly effort had subdued With inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark To keep the exchange rate pegged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s policies had created producing widespread disaffection and pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> ahead in the polls Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s political fortune <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy This put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> in a bind The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals the media and the imagination but are full of practical pitfalls If the pound had been tied to the mark the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates The reason is simple When a country cuts tax rates it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency It was fear of disturbing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> exchange rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> to be timid about cutting tax rates Edouard Balladur the finance minister at the time was sold on the tax cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship The price of attracting capital whether one s own or that of foreigners is a trade deficit To avoid this deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consequently Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> saddled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> with a record trade deficit renewed inflation and high interest rates three political failures in a row Little wonder that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s opponents were so anxious to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> in office It is extraordinary that the British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound The British balance of payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40 the flow abroad of British capital slowed to 50 billion pounds 79 billion at the current rate in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986 This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency s value that was pushed up by tax rate reduction Then when the currency falls interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate This policy is totally mindless and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany A</ENAMEX> unified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> that remained within the Western alliance would give <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> would become vassals of the German state Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> collapses German reunification is likely to require <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> s neutralization The implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain France</ENAMEX> and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s resignation to be unfortunate In the least we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange rate intervention to offset the effects of tax rate reduction on capital flows Mr Roberts was assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary under President <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Reagan</ENAMEX>
