When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco Undoubtedly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention while they privately encourage more assertive U S action to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> and safeguard their countries from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> onslaught The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg It originates in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration decision not to antagonize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Congress</ENAMEX> and avoid at all costs being accused of meddling in the region The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U S leadership which leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> open to Soviet adventurism The influence of the U S is not being felt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America Washington</ENAMEX> s decisions do not respond to a policy and are divorced from reality says Fernando Volio a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister The disarray of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration s Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> States to condemn categorically <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Noriega Faced</ENAMEX> with this embarrassment U S diplomats expressed confidence that the influential <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rio Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South American</ENAMEX> nations which gathered last week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator But other than a few slaps on the wrist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> went unpunished by that body too he was not even singled out in the closing statement Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> will come to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> and encounter Nicaraguan strongman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> eager for photo opportunities with the U S president The host Costa Rican <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Oscar Arias</ENAMEX> did not invite <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile Cuba Panama</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Haiti</ENAMEX> to the summit which was to be restricted to democracies However <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> was included Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press Even Carlos Manuel Castillo the presidential candidate for Mr Arias s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Liberation Party</ENAMEX> made public his opposition to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> in a democratic festivity Nevertheless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tela Honduras</ENAMEX> to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> rebels According to officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> hoped that by pleasing President Arias it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> until after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s promises of democratic elections were tested next February However relying on an ardent critic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> movement for help in delaying the disarming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> was risky business And even some last minute phone calls that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> made at the behest of some conservative U S senators to enlist backing for the U S position failed to stop the march of Mr Arias s agenda Prior to this episode <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Christopher Dodd D Conn</ENAMEX> sensing an open field undertook a personal diplomatic mission through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> to promote an early disbanding of the rebels <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Visiting Nicaragua</ENAMEX> he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honduras</ENAMEX> where the Contras are a hot political issue he promised to help unblock some 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Aid</ENAMEX> was also the gist of the talks <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sen Dodd</ENAMEX> had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani Mr Cristiani s government is very much at the mercy of U S largess and is forced to listen very carefully to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sen Dodd</ENAMEX> s likes and dislikes It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U S virtually neglected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December long before the elections Fittingly the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans the Dodd plan The individual foreign policy carried out by U S legislators adds to a confusing U S performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> On Oct 3 following conversations with Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">State James Baker Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Managua</ENAMEX> to acclaim <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> s great peace efforts There <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan The U S S R would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> after the February election if the U S did likewise with its allies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> He also called on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> s neighbors to accept a military equilibrium guaranteed by both superpowers The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> claims that in spite of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> s words East bloc weapons continue to flow into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> at near record levels Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> s proposals followed discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> speculations arose that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> This scheme would fit the Arias Plan which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> dictatorship and that provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> to freely elected governments Furthermore it is also likely to encourage those on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> asking for cuts in the assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Salvador</ENAMEX> if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas The sad condition of U S policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> is best depicted by the recent end to U S sponsorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX> In 1984 the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country flooded by airwaves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> propaganda Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX> funded by the U S and affiliated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America VOA A</ENAMEX> few months ago the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration decided to stop this cooperation leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX> operating on a shoestring According to news reports the abrupt termination was due to fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VOA</ENAMEX> transmissions could interfere with the peace process In the meantime <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> another powerful radio transmitter which has been installed in the city of Esteli It is capable of reaching the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> area and deep into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U S default The Soviet entrenchment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> is alarming for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> a peaceful democracy without an army Questioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> about what would happen if his much heralded peace plan would fail President Arias voiced expectations of direct U S action A poll conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64 of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> the U S will come to its defense But in the light of events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> where the U S has such clear strategic interests waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit Mr Daremblum is a lawyer and a columnist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Nacion</ENAMEX> newspaper
