Mcdonald s Corp under pressure by environmental groups to stop using polystyrene containers announced a program here to foster recycling of the plastics at 450 of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> restaurants Environmentalists however attacked Mcdonald s program as a public relations ploy and the wrong way to address the nation s garbage crisis Under the program Mcdonald s restaurants will be equipped with recycling bins for plastic items and with posters encouraging customers to use them the company said The plastic will be sent to a plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leominster Mass</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> which is owned by a joint venture recently formed by plastics makers It then will be processed into plastic pellets for use in making products such as trash cans flower pots and food trays but not food containers Mcdonald s said The program will reduce trash help educate youngsters about recycling and is a big step toward a better environment asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shelby Yastrow Mcdonald</ENAMEX> s senior vice president environmental affairs However it will be a small step for Mcdonald s as a whole The program will include 4 of the company s 11 000 restaurants And because many customers won t participate such as people who drive through it is likely that less than 2 of the company s plastic containers will be recycled under the program Mcdonald s said it plans to expand the program when and if more plastic recycling plants are built near its restaurants The plant in Leominster is the first of five planned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Polystyrene Recycling Co</ENAMEX> the plastics industry joint venture It was formed earlier this year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Co Mobil Corp</ENAMEX> and six other concerns in response to concerns about growing amounts of non biodegradable plastic trash <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Keough</ENAMEX> acting regional director for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> said We hope that other large companies follow Mcdonald s lead to undertake similar programs But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Perry</ENAMEX> a spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> offshoot of Ralph Nader s lobbying outfits argued that the program just serves to legitimize increasing the use of throwaway plastics It would be far better for Mcdonald s to use durable goods that could be reused for serving food instead of promoting the throwaway society Last year a network of environmental groups commenced a Mctoxics Campaign to pressure Mcdonald s to stop using polystyrene Among other things the groups have urged consumers to mail used Mcdonald s plastic containers to its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oak Brook Ill</ENAMEX> headquarters Concerns about plastic trash also have sparked legislative initiatives such as one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeley Calif</ENAMEX> to ban polystyrene products as of January Such laws are causing major headaches for companies like Mcdonald s which increasingly must wrestle with different local rules across the nation Political pressure has been a factor in the introduction of recycling programs by plastics makers and sellers conceded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ken Harman National Polystyrene</ENAMEX> s acting president and chairman at the news conference which was held in a Mcdonald s restaurant next to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> s Children s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> Some of the pressure became evident during the news conference when a Mcdonald s customer startled company officials by blurting out Why do you produce so much trash in the first place The customer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Simpson</ENAMEX> a visitor from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> later explained that he was vexed by all the plastic paper and cardboard that came with the Mcdonald s breakfast he had just eaten The recycling program is laudable he said but why not use china plates
