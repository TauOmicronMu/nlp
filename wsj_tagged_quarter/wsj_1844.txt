whose Della Femina Mcnamee WCRS agency created liar Joe Isuzu among others announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> based Eurocom The complex restructuring which was long expected transforms <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> based WCRS from primarily a creator of advertising into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> s largest buyers of advertising time and space It also creates a newly merged world wide ad agency controlled by Eurocom and headed jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> ad man Jerry Della Femina and two top WCRS executives The merged agency s admittedly ambitious goal to become one of the world s 10 largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone WCRS s restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk For Eurocom meanwhile the move gives it a strong U S foothold in Della Femina and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world wide It also gives the outspoken Mr Della Femina who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly won t be loath to use According to terms WCRS will pay 2 02 billion French francs 318 6 million for the 50 it doesn t already own of Carat Holding S A one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> s largest media buyers Meanwhile Eurocom which had held 20 of WCRS s ad unit will pay 43 5 million 68 5 million to raise its stake to 60 That price also covers Eurocom raising to 60 its 51 stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> s Belier Group a joint venture ad agency network it owns with WCRS Eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining 40 of the merged ad agency group in six years The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd</ENAMEX> or EWDB The merged agency will include Della Femina Mcnamee based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Eurocom</ENAMEX> s various agencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> the Belier Group in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and WCRS s other advertising and direct marketing operations Mr Della Femina will be joint chairman with former WCRS executive Robin Wight Both will report to Tim Breene a former WCRS executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency In an interview in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Mr Breene</ENAMEX> fresh from a Concorde flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> where executives had worked through most of the night outlined big plans for the new agency Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top 10 position by the end of three years from now It implies very dramatic growth he said He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed to provide a development fund of 100 million for acquisitions The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> while Mr Breene said it also plans to make acquisitions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia Germany</ENAMEX> and elsewhere Cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best Della Femina had billings of just 660 million last year and ranked as the U S s 24th largest ad agency The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than 2 6 billion most of that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> bringing it to about 14th world wide To make it to top 10 status it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising D Arcy Masius Benton Bowles and Omnicom s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX> The merged agency s game plan to attract multinational packaged goods advertisers may prove equally difficult When WCRS created Della Femina Mcnamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 it said it did so in order to attract larger clients especially packaged goods companies Since then Della Femina won <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> as an international client and also does work for a few packaged goods clients including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Co</ENAMEX> s Saran Wrap But major packaged goods players of the world such as Procter Gamble Colgate Palmolive and Unilever have steadfastly eluded the agency Three of our favorite names Mr Della Femina calls that roster adding hopefully We re a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday Still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media buying firms that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> has seen As part of the restructuring WCRS and Eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> What s more both Eurocom and brothers Francis and Gilbert Gross who founded Carat will acquire 14 99 stakes in WCRS Group creating a powerful link between Eurocom and Carat Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50 Carat stake that WCRS is buying while Eurocom said it expects to pay about 32 million for its WCRS stake Mr Della Femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world wide agency serving as a sort of creative conscience Louise Mcnamee Della Femina s president will continue running the U S agency day to day They and other top executives signed long term employment contracts and Mr Della Femina will receive an additional multimillion dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about 10 million WCRS Group for its part will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming a holding company for a series of media related businesses said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Scott</ENAMEX> the firm s chief executive In addition to Carat WCRS will hold onto its public relations TV programming and other businesses WCRS says its debt will be cut to 24 million from 66 million as a result of the transaction For Carat meanwhile the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended to strengthen its own push outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France Carat</ENAMEX> s Gross brothers invented the idea of large scale buying of media space By buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as 50 which they can pass on to customers They thus have won the French space buying business of such advertising giants as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca Cola Co Fiat S</ENAMEX> p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Gillette</ENAMEX> and Kodak But now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media buying groups and Carat wants to expand to the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> To help finance the Carat purchase WCRS said it plans an issue of Euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down But WCRS added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged medium term debt financing which would be underwritten by <ENAMEX
