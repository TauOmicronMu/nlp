Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> s own listed companies led by giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contel Corp</ENAMEX> are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange s role in it Claiming program trading has turned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> into a gambling casino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter</ENAMEX> said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance The group Mr Wohlstetter said in an interview wants to end the market s wild price swings that critics blame on computer aided program trading strategies The group will complain to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> to the heads of program trading firms and to the heads of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> itself he said They should call the exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump East</ENAMEX> charged Mr Wohlstetter the 79 year old founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contel</ENAMEX> who s also a former investment banker and stock trader What is the mission of the financial community to help some scavengers or schemers or help corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America Contel</ENAMEX> is a 6 billion telephone and electronics company Pressure has been building on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility which many investors say is caused by program trading The market s Friday the 13th plunge of 190 points in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> s understated response to it galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange Last month program trading accounted for a record 13 8 of average daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume Mr Wohlstetter for example said he wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board Chairman John J Phelan Jr</ENAMEX> about program trading after the 190 point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> plunge and as in previous queries what I get back is gobbledygook He said he s upset that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phelan</ENAMEX> trying to calm investors after the plunge said that investors would simply have to get used to the market s big price swings The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is partly to blame for the price swings because they re cowards said Mr Wohlstetter Their powerful members manage them The focus of the outcry has been stock index arbitrage which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets but critics say such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richard Grasso Big Board</ENAMEX> president last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents Privately exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> s It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock basket product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard Poor s index in a single trade One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers according to the exchange Investors have complained for some time about program trading particularly index arbitrage to little avail But according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> traders an organized campaign from exchange listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes They won t fight the listed companies Now the assault is on said one top trader The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> can t ban stock index futures of course but it could ban use of its high speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when last year it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm s program trading volume <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contel</ENAMEX> s Mr Wohlstetter said the group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> companies isn t ready to go public yet with its effort and that he doesn t plan to be the leader once it is public However he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support Among those Mr Wohlstetter said he has been talking to are Sanford Weill of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica Corp</ENAMEX> which is the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith Barney Harris Upham Co GTE Corp</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Johnson</ENAMEX> and ITT Corp s Rand Araskog None of these chief executives were available for comment Among the targets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> companies campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contel</ENAMEX> s part the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program trading firms It was just those kinds of ultimatums that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate Kemper Corp s Kemper Financial Services unit said it cut off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns Morgan Stanley Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody Co</ENAMEX> unit All of the firms except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> which is the second biggest program trader on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> quickly announced pull backs from index arbitrage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX> said that despite the outcry even by some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> s own brokers he believes index arbitrage doesn t have a negative impact on the market as a whole However pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> s parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> could change <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> s policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Chairman John Welch</ENAMEX> has been besieged with phone calls complaining about his unit s program trading according to a person close to him
