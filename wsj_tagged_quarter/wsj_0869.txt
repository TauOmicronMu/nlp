After more than a year of losing accounts and watching its reputation slide Ogilvy Mather s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office hired away a top creative executive from flashy Chiat as its creative head Ogilvy a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bill Hamilton</ENAMEX> 47 to the top creative post in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> had been an executive vice president and creative head of Chiat s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office known for its funky work for Arrow shirts Nynex yellow pages and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Klein II</ENAMEX> At Ogilvy he succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Berry</ENAMEX> who left the agency in June but now plans to return to the parent company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Chiat Day</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Clow</ENAMEX> the agency s president and chief creative director will fill in as acting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> creative director until the naming of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> s successor or possibly successors within the next few weeks <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> faces a daunting task in reviving Ogilvy s stagnant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office Just a few months ago <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> yanked its 50 million account from the office following the loss last year of the 40 million Hallmark account The office has won just a single piece of new business and a tiny one at that this year and new business wins weren t substantial last year either The office is suffering from a dead battery as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Gottesman</ENAMEX> an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> puts it And while it can be turned around he says It ain t easy and it s been parked underneath a snowdrift for a very long time The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office is just one of many Ogilvy outposts plenty of which are performing well But it is the largest and most visible With about 800 million in billings it s bigger than most entire agencies And while it has won praise for some of its creative work especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> it hasn t been able to attract substantial new business Ogilvy last spring hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lesser</ENAMEX> 47 from Lowe Marschalk to head up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> operations but Mr Lesser hasn t had a strong creative leader to work with him Industry executives generally lauded the move to bring in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> saying the office needs a kick from the outside But they questioned whether there might be a culture clash between buttoned up Ogilvy and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> an 11 year veteran of Chiat Day s freewheeling no walls no doors culture <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> after all presided over among other things the weird U B U Reebok campaign while at Chiat Day Ogilvy creates more mainstream ads for clients including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Seagram</ENAMEX> and Mattel But in an interview <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> said a culture clash is part of the agenda I think they want some infusion of a different attitude about how you go about communicating the advantages of a certain client He added A certain amount of chaos is very good in agencies And he said he hopes within three months to be playing football in the halls at 5 30 in the afternoon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> talked broadly of some of the changes he d like to make at Ogilvy Chiat Day is one of the few American agencies to successfully use British account planning a method Ogilvy attempted briefly and largely unsuccessfully and which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> hopes to ultimately bring with him In account planning an executive with a research background represents the consumer working closely with creative and account executives <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> also said he might also bring over some Chiat Day veterans though from non <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> offices <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Hamilton</ENAMEX> accepted the job after repeated discussions not just with Mr Lesser but with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> s chief executive officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sorrell</ENAMEX> who has taken a hands on approach with his acquisition I probably wouldn t have accepted the job had it not been the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Lesser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> he said I ve always been intrigued by those things people say can t be done Most of the wags and the pundits of the world will say it s pretty tough stuff to turn around an agency that s been going in one direction for a long time he said But I don t think it the issue is turning it around I think it s getting back to where it was 10 or 15 years ago There are pockets of brilliance there now Kraft Taps Margeotes Kraft General Foods Group has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margeotes Fertitta Weiss</ENAMEX> a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> agency to try its hand at some creative work on a new product A Kraft General Foods spokesman said Margeotes has been given an assignment to do some development work on a venture project Executives close to the <ENAMEX
