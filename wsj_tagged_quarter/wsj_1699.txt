Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake ravaged <ENAMEX

conferring with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> lawmakers It s impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time The Office of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management</ENAMEX> and Budget

financial officer said I wouldn t expect this to have any significant financial impact The city s recovery from the earthquake was uneven Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 of their usual capacity but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nob Hill</ENAMEX> hotel said tourists had fled leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 vacancy rate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>

houses in the city s outer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX> district that were heaved off their foundations Many streets and sidewalks buckled and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured The federal funds would go to a range of programs including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX> highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration according to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rep Vic Fazio D Calif FEMA</ENAMEX> which coordinates federal disaster relief is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo which hit the Carolinas last month It is likely to get as much as 800 million initially in additional funds and eventually could get more than 1 billion according to Mr Fazio a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Appropriations Committee White House</ENAMEX> spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration has at its disposal 273 million in funds remaining from the 1 1 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate short term requirements Mr Fitzwater said He added that the Office of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management</ENAMEX> and Budget the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and other agencies are developing longer term legislation that should be ready soon Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state Some things can t be repaired The Asian <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Art Museum</ENAMEX> in Golden Gate Park reports 10 million to 15 million in damage including shattered porcelains and stone figures Its neighbor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Young Museum</ENAMEX> totaled 3 million to 5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture The city s main library

destroyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Agnos</ENAMEX> s 2 billion estimate doesn t include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city some of which remained closed A major chunk of the 2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency said a spokesman for Mr Agnos All of the city s 5 9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours on overtime salaries he said Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices At Fireman s Fund Corp a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake and the company is braced for as many as 5 000 claims from its 35 000 residential and 35 000 business policyholders in the affected area Claims range from a scratched fender and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this to a major processing plant a spokesman said We re delivering a check for 750 000 to an automotive business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX>

it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a 100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads In addition under the highway relief program the federal government provides 100 of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort After that the federal share diminishes For interstate highways the federal share normally would drop to 90 of the cost of repairs and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100 federal funding for several months Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hurricane Hugo South Carolina</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> according to an aide to Rep Fazio Meanwhile the FEMA announced a toll free telephone number 800 462 9029 to expedite service to victims of the earthquake Lines will be available 24 hours a day to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning Monday and growing worse over the next several weeks Some 250 000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> daily Officials say it is clear that alternate routes can t handle the overflow The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem Moreover state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area s main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours Even so We re looking for chaos said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">George Gray</ENAMEX> a deputy district director at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Department</ENAMEX> of Transportation If there s any way you can do it you ought to go
