There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad After years of mistrust born of Watergate past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran Contra</ENAMEX> scandal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> appear ready for now at least to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities If that attitude lasts it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that hasn t been seen in years Over the past week the president has agreed to keep the committee informed usually in advance of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing That wasn t always the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration handled such matters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> has pledged as well to respect the 14 year old executive order barring U S agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> never fully trusted former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Adviser John Poindexter</ENAMEX> to honor the ban Despite objections by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CIA Mr Bush</ENAMEX> also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> who would be independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> director In return the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity It also has removed a ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> didn t get back in the assassination game We ve finally been able to convince them that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> don t work here anymore says one administration official The new understanding didn t just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light It emerged after a rancorous display of old style intelligence politics that followed this month s failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U S support for such coups difficult <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> even disclosed privately that one <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> era deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> if the U S learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life The president also hinted he might veto this year s intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren D Okla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vice Chairman William Cohen R Maine</ENAMEX> for their part angrily accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for the bungled attempt to topple <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Noriega</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans who don t want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities Instead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> and his aides made it clear they respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> s role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr Boren and the moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Cohen</ENAMEX> to iron out their differences The senators responded in kind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sen Boren</ENAMEX> happily told reporters that there had been a meeting of the minds with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and that the committee had given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> a clean slate free of the impediments imposed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Cohen</ENAMEX> said the relationship has reverted to its pre <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> character There still are some details to be nailed down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> is reserving the right in rare instances to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in the dark asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee doesn t recognize And a pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled Moreover both sides may face political critics Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> too much And they continue anonymously attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA Director William Webster</ENAMEX> for being too accommodating to the committee At the same time some congressional liberals will accuse Sens Boren and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> of wimping out and they will warn that the lawmakers concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> arms sales But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities the country could be entering an era when such hare brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards while risky but well planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will balk
