attests and a proud employee says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two Welcome to the 28th <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo Motor Show</ENAMEX> Here you can find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> Motors Corp displaying a live fish transporter a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels and

sport vehicle features a pop out rear tent and invites drivers to go back to the nature But this biennial event the world s largest display of cars and trucks has its serious side including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle suspension systems It s also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged and therein lies the draw Even the biggest auto shows in the U S are largely regional affairs but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> show is international Virtually every automotive analyst in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> showed up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> flights were booked solid this week as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor

firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported and what the foreign visitors saw New Technology The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps potholes and other rigors of the road These active suspension systems electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car s ride Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> in a 34 page tract modestly compares its hydraulic active suspension to a cheetah and equates the various parts to the animal s heart brain nerves and blood vessels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp</ENAMEX> grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension s inner workings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> s Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring But drivers in the U S must wait The Japanese for now are keeping active suspension for domestic use only And <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> s Big Three auto makers say their systems are still under development In the engine department several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today s engines and yet take up only half the space allowing for shorter hoods In the so called two stroke engines which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage each piston goes up and down only once to provide power By contrast the pistons in conventional four stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle The two stroke engine displays by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and Fuji Heavy Industries the maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subaru</ENAMEX> cars drew plenty of interest from U S auto executives who are rushing to develop two stroke engines <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co</ENAMEX> shows a more conventional five cylinder engine in the new Accord Inspire model which made its debut just this month in <ENAMEX

Funny Names There s plenty of whimsy here but it isn t always clear whether it s intentional The show s symbol is a woman riding on a snail not your usual metaphor for speed and agility But the sponsors have an explanation Through the character associated with a snail they say important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought Japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high or low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> has a tiny motorcycle called the Monkey and a slightly larger cousin the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorilla Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> has a futuristic delivery truck called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guppy Mazda</ENAMEX> has the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bongo</ENAMEX> truck and under its Autozam nameplate a microvan called the Scrum Its buglike Carol minicar is designed with softness gentleness and warmheartedness But the court jester appears to be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s smallest car maker Daihatsu Motor Co One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike Sneaker which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear Daihatsu also has the Fellow 90 the Leeza Spider and the Hijet Dumbo The jokes aren t just on the Japanese though Regie Nationale des Usines Renault the

design in explaining his pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo Show Even</ENAMEX> so traditional American cockiness isn t terribly endangered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
