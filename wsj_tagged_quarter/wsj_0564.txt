<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> s most famous raider says he isn t one Werner K Rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly And in little more than a decade of being friendly and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U S style wheeling and dealing the 46 year old Mr Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies His latest coup September s masterminding of the five billion Swiss franc 3 07 billion merger between Adia S A the world s second largest temporary employment agency and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inspectorate International S A</ENAMEX> a Rey controlled product inspection company Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November But approval is almost certain since Mr Rey and a friendly Adia management are in control After the transaction Mr Rey estimates the value of his 20 stake in the new company to be held by his Omni Holding AG will be about 1 billion Swiss francs This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs Mr Rey bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982 building up the little known engineering company with European and U S acquisitions I like to succeed says Mr Rey during a recent morning of working at home which he also likes Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Geneva</ENAMEX> and a low slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps In the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers There is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Renoir</ENAMEX> on the wall <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX> based magazine Bilanz lists Mr Rey as having a fortune of about 1 5 billion Swiss francs Writes Bilanz No one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> ever came so far so fast He was simply the first in this country to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked up In short Rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets However the Swiss financial press in general as well as many analysts have had a hard time making up their minds about Mr Rey and his un Swiss ways For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> s most prestigious newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung Mr Rey seems destined to remain the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally</ENAMEX> raider an image that has proved hard to overcome In 1976 as an upstart in the eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> s establishment Mr Rey laid the foundations of his present day prominence with an unheard of raid on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally</ENAMEX> the country s traditional shoemaker Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> where he was working as a financial consultant he learned that a large packet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally</ENAMEX> s shares was up for sale Looking into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally</ENAMEX> he could hardly believe what he saw a company with enormous real estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs it had 7 000 employees Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife Mr Rey acquired 20 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally</ENAMEX> s shares But such tactics were alien to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> in 1976 and still aren t common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain Eventually Mr Rey was forced to sell his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally</ENAMEX> shares to the weapons maker <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oerlikon Buehrle Holding AG</ENAMEX> as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys network Mr Rey made 50 million Swiss francs on the sale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally</ENAMEX> was not an unfriendly takeover he insists Buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible Mr Rey contends I bought from willing shareholders Nevertheless Mr Rey has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome And he has worked to shed his raider image In 1979 his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve based in Thun With the nonferrous metals business undermined in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs this looked like a dull undertaking But Mr Rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country s major producers the increased efficiency has perked up the industry Three years later machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S A was to become part of the Rey empire Once again the company s future looked less than rosy But after restructuring under new management the profits began rolling in A major boost to Mr Rey s respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60 of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad In 1987 Mr Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Frey AG</ENAMEX> a major producer of magazines and newspapers And with the recent acquisition of 30 of Winterthur based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG Mr Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight Sulzer preferred him to financier Tito Tettamanti whose secretive raid on the company s stock had led to a bitter battle Meanwhile as such strategic investments have mounted the merchant banking arm of Mr Rey s Omni Holding has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies often after a financial or corporate restructuring Today this branch of Mr Rey s empire runs under the name Omnicorp Offering Services and handles mergers and acquisitions placement of securities and real estate In its portfolio are such diverse companies as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Air Europe Checkrobot Inc</ENAMEX> a U S company that makes supermarket checkout machines Norment Industries a U S manufacturer of securities systems Com Systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> a U S regional telephone company and major real estate projects in the U S and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> For financial analysts reading Omni s accounts is a tough challenge Companies move in and out says Helga Kern of KK Swiss Investment Financial analysts note that Mr Rey is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real estate interests In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August Omni</ENAMEX> unexpectedly bought Inspectorate s 80 stake in Harpener AG of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> a land rich company The internal transaction within the Rey empire puzzled Harpener s small shareholders but analysts say it makes sense for Inspectorate Adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help Mr Rey says the move is yet another example of his conservatism He explains that companies with real estate give security The real estate can be used he points out as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development He says he wants to influence but not manage companies I don t want to be like financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> and the other Australians I don t want companies to be built around me as a person I want them to stand alone
