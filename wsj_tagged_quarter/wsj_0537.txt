After days of intense but fruitless negotiations a federal judge last week threatened to convert <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> s Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Harold C Abramson</ENAMEX> raised the possibility after talks to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks If the case is converted to Chapter 7 what remains of the oil tycoon s once vast estate now believed to have a value of less than 125 million would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> whose claim for 300 million in back taxes has priority in the case Hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing according to attorneys involved While admitting such a move would be devastating to most creditors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Abramson</ENAMEX> told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hunt</ENAMEX> s shrinking estate and about the fact that following voting by creditors none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form It would be a shame to have a Chapter 7 after all the progress in this case said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Abramson</ENAMEX> Under Chapter 11 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> a company continues to operate under protection from creditors lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts Under Chapter 7 the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors Despite his reluctance to take the latter step the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco S A</ENAMEX> a minerals concern owned by the Peruvian governmemt The Manufacturers Hanover Corp unit which is seeking repayment of a 36 million loan has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> which won a 132 million judgment against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hunt</ENAMEX> his brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in While claiming that penalties legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than 250 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as 65 7 million But even that is disputed by Manufacturers Hanover which in alliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver conspiracy case Under prodding from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Abramson</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> executive flew in from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> last week to talk directly with executives from Manufacturers Hanover on a settlement Despite long private sessions in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> the two sides ended the week 6 000 miles and many dollars apart according to attorney Hugh Ray who represents Manufacturers Hanover Meanwhile inside the courtroom the judge said he would fine attorneys for the two creditors 50 every time they referred to each other with terms such as liar or slime All three major creditors the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS Minpeco</ENAMEX> and Manufacturers Hanover voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hunt A</ENAMEX> reorganization plan proposed jointly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and Manufacturers Hanover was stalled by a negative vote from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> The mineral concern s own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and Manufacturers Hanover Neither plan is dead however and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> Manufacturers Hanover dispute Meanwhile settlement negotiations continue between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hunt</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> which has already reached a tentative agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> The two sides have been far apart on how much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> will continue to owe the government after his assets are sold
