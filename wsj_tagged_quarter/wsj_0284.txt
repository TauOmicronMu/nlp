A federal judge ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imelda Marcos</ENAMEX> wasn t brought to the U S against her will and that marital privileges which protect spouses from incriminating each other don t apply in her case As a result <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge John F Keenan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U S requests for evidence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> had claimed that she didn t have to turn over the documents because she was brought here involuntarily and because providing the materials would violate her marital privilege In 1988 a year and a half after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> and her late husband <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Marcos</ENAMEX> the ousted president of the Philippines fled the Philippines for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> they were charged with racketeering conspiracy obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than 100 million from their homeland Much of the money was fraudulently concealed through purchases of prime <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> real estate federal prosecutors have charged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> s trial is expected to begin in March U S law requires criminal defendants to turn over foreign documents such as those sought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> case The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants use of foreign procedures to block U S requests for records <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Keenan</ENAMEX> said in his opinion For instance the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts The U S has charged that the Marcoses alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the Philippines <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> the U S and other countries On the allegation of kidnapping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Keenan</ENAMEX> wrote The suggestion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> was brought to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation The judge also said the two marital testimonial privileges cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> don t apply The first one permits a witness to refuse to testify against her spouse But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Keenan</ENAMEX> said that privilege s purpose is fostering harmony in marriage Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Marcos</ENAMEX> died Sept 28 the privilege can no longer apply the judge said The second marital privilege cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> protects confidential communications between spouses But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Keenan</ENAMEX> said that privilege is meant to protect private utterances not litigation papers filed with foreign governments as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> s attorneys maintained Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Keenan</ENAMEX> threw out most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> s objections he agreed with one of her concerns that turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant s constitutional right against self incrimination As a result he said he will examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> documents sought by the prosecutors to determine whether turning over the filings is self incrimination <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Keenan</ENAMEX> also directed the prosecutors to show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> s Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination won t be violated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Marcos</ENAMEX> s attorney in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Sandor Frankel</ENAMEX>
