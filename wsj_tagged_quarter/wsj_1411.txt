The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas Cowboys</ENAMEX> are looking at a long yardage situation struggling to pull ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta Falcons Up</ENAMEX> in his stadium box their new and controversial owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerral Jerry Jones</ENAMEX> watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> takes heart There in the center of the pack is quarterback Troy Aikman the key to the Cowboys comeback strategy So key in fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> signed him in April for 11 4 million over the next six years a record for a rookie He s a genuine Wheaties box athlete gushes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> With three minutes left on the clock Mr Aikman takes the snap steps back and fires a 21 yard pass straight into the hands of an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> defensive back The crowd groans <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> shakes his head the Cowboys lose the game A few days after that Sept 17 game Mr Aikman broke a finger sidelining him for weeks Ah the glamour of professional sports For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas Cowboys</ENAMEX> and this year much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Football League Once</ENAMEX> fat and happy the Cowboys now are losing games fans and money Last year the team ended up 2 million in the red on 30 million in revenue It has some of the highest costs in the league Its attendance is off 23 from six years ago At the very least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> who cultivates the society circuit as eagerly as his bench can take comfort in one fact These days he isn t alone Nearly half the owners of the 28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Football League</ENAMEX> teams are losing money the result of flat attendance aging stadiums and more than anything skyrocketing salaries for star players like Mr Aikman Last year the top 12 players on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> team took home an average 536 000 a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball First round draft picks have done even better Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to 685 000 this year up 44 from 1987 It s a vicious circle says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Art Modell</ENAMEX> owner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland Browns One</ENAMEX> team pays so much and the other pays more We just don t have that kind of income stream All this is causing convulsions in professional football Owners largely complacent in the past are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process Though not intentionally the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cowboys Mr Jones</ENAMEX> has come to represent this new breed of owner Shortly after buying 66 of the team from H R Bum Bright for 145 million and mindful of the Cowboys ragged bottom line the 47 year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> set about his own round of team cuts First he unceremoniously sacked Tom Landry the legendary coach who took the Cowboys to five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas Mr Landry</ENAMEX> has a standing just shy of sainthood <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anti Jones</ENAMEX> sentiment flooded the local press A crude obnoxious hick said one writer a real oink said another Who in the hell does he think he is wrote a third For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> it was just the beginning He quickly cut the team s bloated administrative staff by half shut down a Cowboys owned dance academy and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> announced plans to sell Valley Ranch the team s 30 acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NFL Mr Jones</ENAMEX> calls the ranch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> of Sportdom It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms elaborate spas and weight training centers that testify to a richer more free spending era He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help I said Somebody come get me I m at extension 29 With a new day dawning on the sport <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> doesn t see a place for this sort of luxury It s just not cost efficient he says The place costs nearly 2 million a year to maintain When he sells it he says the Cowboys will move to a more practical read affordable grass practice field near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> And as for Tom Landry well in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> s mind he had played out his winning years After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the Cowboys needed a change he says Football has long been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> s passion both on and off the field An <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> native he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> team that won a national championship After college he worked at his father s insurance company in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Little Rock</ENAMEX> and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego Chargers Years</ENAMEX> later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded Arkoma Production Corp an oil and gas exploration company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Little Rock</ENAMEX> So it wasn t surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> returned to his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr Landry He tapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Johnson</ENAMEX> a teammate on the 1964 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> squad and the head coach at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987 Whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Johnson</ENAMEX> s talents in the hearts and minds of many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> fans he is no Tom Landry Seven games and after a loss to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City Chiefs</ENAMEX> yesterday seven losses into the season the new Cowboys aren t doing any better than the old In fact the last time they played this badly was in 1960 their opening season Average attendance at their games about 49 000 last year continues flat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> is attacking the problem on several fronts He continues to reshuffle the team trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota Vikings</ENAMEX> this month for a slew of players and future draft picks To try to draw more fans he has dropped end zone ticket prices from 25 to 19 But the general trend given rising costs in the league has been to raise prices and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> is expected to eventually follow suit It s simple says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Hunt</ENAMEX> who owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City Chiefs</ENAMEX> and last year raised ticket prices by 2 40 to an average 17 If we didn t increase prices we d be in the red <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium The suites are air conditioned have wet bars and plush seating and offer a clear view of the field all for a sale price of 475 000 to 1 million depending on their size and location <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider s look at the team s strategy before game time The sales job seems to be paying off When he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold Today 30 have Gate receipts are only the Cowboys second largest source of cash The biggest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> s contract with national television for broadcast of the league s games Last year the Cowboys share of that pie came to 17 6 million The team additionally earns between 2 million and 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights He is also trying to get more stations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> where the Cowboys have a following to pick up the games <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works 16 hour days is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days He calls the contracts critical to winning in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> and has played his part in the bidding wars Besides signing Mr Aikman to a sizable contract <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh 4 1 million over the next four years This wage inflation is bleeding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> dry the owners contend Soon only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams predicts John J Veatch Jr an investment banker with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> Brothers who handled the Cowboys sale To tackle the problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries Details of the plan which would go into effect in 1993 are sketchy but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL Players Association</ENAMEX> meanwhile contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management not players salaries The owners are trying to boost profit in other ways too Many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts Most of the owners must pay up to 10 of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> for example size is the issue We have the worst lease in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael B Mccaskey</ENAMEX> the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago Bears</ENAMEX> and a grandson of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">George Halas</ENAMEX> who founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> s predecessor organization We re in a metro area with millions of Bear fans and only a small number can be accommodated When the lease expires in 1999 he says It s got to be changed This year the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> also imposed an 80 player limit on teams going into training camp down from 120 in a move meant to trim payroll costs And the league is trying to get more for its three year national network contract which expires after this season The current contract pays the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> 1 4 billion Owners say they expect the league to demand a 50 increase despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable TV companies like ESPN The changes haven t come easy Like the game of professional football the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> organization itself is in turmoil The new breed of team owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> included has been fighting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> 11 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Finks</ENAMEX> as a replacement for retiring league commissioner Pete Rozelle Mr Finks is perceived by some owners as a standard bearer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Guard Earlier</ENAMEX> this month another effort to choose a commissioner failed The owners meet again tomorrow For his part <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Jones</ENAMEX> says he s in the business for the long haul and his work style seems to support that He puts in busy six day weeks excluding game days and on one recent afternoon fielded questions in the course of an hour from a TV producer his luxury suite marketing manager a disgruntled customer and a roomful of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> reporters To keep his schedule on track he flies two personal secretaries in from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Little Rock</ENAMEX> to augment his staff in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> When I made this investment I made it on a lifetime basis he explains I m not here to make money by reselling the team later on While the Cowboys may not be the best investment now I don t accept they can t be in the future Besides to a large extent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> may already be getting what he wants out of the team even though it keeps losing Owning the Cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> just didn t provide There is the new private jet the platoon of assistants invitations to the best parties and television appearances on shows such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime Time Live A</ENAMEX> few weeks ago <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> even entertained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX> in his private suite at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> You re in the catbird seat every day in this job he says
