<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp</ENAMEX> is planning a big coming out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party On the morning of the long planned announcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp</ENAMEX> is to introduce its own new mainframe Their attitude is You want to talk mainframes we ll talk mainframes says one computer industry executive They re deliberately trying to steal our thunder a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> executive complains Maybe we should take it as a compliment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> s target is the 40 billion market for mainframe computers the closet sized number crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> based in Armonk N Y has dominated the market for decades That doesn t scare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> which has grown to be the world s second largest computer maker by poaching customers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> s mid range machines <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maynard Mass</ENAMEX> hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes and it has spent almost 1 billion developing the new technology A spoiler nimble Tandem Computers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cupertino Calif</ENAMEX> jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> appears more worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line dubbed the VAX 9000 It s going to be nuclear war says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Willmott</ENAMEX> a consultant with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen Group Inc</ENAMEX> The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> s traditional mainframe rivals including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys Corp Control Data Corp</ENAMEX> and NCR Corp have struggled recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is promising a new approach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert M Glorioso Digital</ENAMEX> s vice president for high performance systems says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> s mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations personal computers printers and other devices And unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> s water cooled mainframes it doesn t need any plumbing The challengers will have a big price advantage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is expected to tag its new line from about 1 24 million to 4 4 million and up depending on configuration That s about half the price of comparably equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes Tandem s pricing is just as aggressive The heightened competition will hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> at a difficult time The computer giant s current mainframe line which has sold well and has huge profit margins is starting to show its age The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8 to 10 And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> isn t expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991 Still no one expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> s rivals to deliver a knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has a near monopoly on mainframes with an estimated 70 share of the market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is five times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> and 40 times the size of Tandem and wields enormous market power It counts among its customers a majority of the world s largest corporations which entrust their most critical business information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> computers We re not going to walk in and replace a company s corporate accounting system if it s already running on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframe concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenneth H Olsen Digital</ENAMEX> s president He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will target faster growing market segments such as on line transaction processing which includes retail sales tracking airline reservations and bank teller networks Tandem which already specializes in on line transaction processing is a potent competitor in that market A key marketing target for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will be the large number of big customers who already own both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> systems One such company is Bankers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trust Co Stanley Rose</ENAMEX> a vice president technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust says that despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> s low prices we aren t about to unplug our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes for a DEC machine The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings But Mr Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000 Bankers Trust uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> s VAX to run its huge money transfer and capital markets accounts juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day he says As that system grows larger computers may be needed In the past customers had to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> when they outgrew the VAX Now they don t have to he says That s going to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> revenue Analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> can expect this pent up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry F Willman</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford C Bernstein Co</ENAMEX> estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than 1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> s largest customers Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will announce a full family of mainframes next week it isn t expected to begin shipping in volume until next year The first model available will be the 210 which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super charger or vector processor says Terry Shannon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Data Corp</ENAMEX> a market research concern Four more models aimed squarely at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> s commercial customers are expected to begin shipping in late June Most analysts don t expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter which begins next <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> s new line has been a long time coming The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe class product and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> s failure to deliver a true mainframe class machine before now may have cost the company as much as 1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989 Mr Willman says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will face still more competition in coming months Amdahl Corp backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu Ltd</ENAMEX> has a growing share of the market with its low priced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> compatible machines And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Advanced</ENAMEX> Systems a joint venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi Ltd</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp</ENAMEX> s Electronic Data Systems is expected to unveil a line of powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> compatible mainframes later this year NOTE
