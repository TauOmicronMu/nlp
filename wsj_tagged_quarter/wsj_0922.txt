Western European leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal the dizzying political changes under way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe French President Francois Mitterrand European Community Commission President Jacques Delors Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez</ENAMEX> and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the East to the need to speed up changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> They are stressing that the best way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> to help the East is to move faster towards Western European economic and monetary unity This would make the market oriented system more attractive to Eastern countries they argue and allow greater economic aid and technological know how to flow from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> to East The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East Mr Mitterrand told the European Parliament in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strasbourg</ENAMEX> yesterday is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Mr Mitterrand</ENAMEX> proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> allowing a European central bank and that the treaty be ratified by 1992 Mr Mitterrand also proposed a separate Bank for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> that would channel development money to the East One basis for linking change in the East and change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> is the notion that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans despite the U S s obvious strategic and economic interest Says a European strategist The U S tends to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> not including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> looks at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> important but far away But for us in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> these are Europeans next door A reintegrated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> implies big changes in 40 year old military and economic policies There is likely to be a natural division of labor says Francois Heisbourg director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Institute</ENAMEX> for Strategic Studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> with the U S more engaged in strategic issues with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> more involved with specific aid measures for the East The designation at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> s economic summit of major industrialized nations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC Commission</ENAMEX> as coordinator of Western aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> was a first step In part this division is dictated by economics <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> is a net exporter of capital while the U S isn t While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> announced a three year four billion French franc 650 million aid plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation some Western European leaders especially British <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> remain skeptical about European political and economic unity and are unlikely to let <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East West</ENAMEX> concerns change their minds But British analysts are beginning to link the issues We need a Western Ostpolitik says John Roper of the Royal Institute of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> Affairs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> s longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the East For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> we need to think about a stick and carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers He notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Plan</ENAMEX> of U S aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> didn t just throw money at post war <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> it also liberalized and opened up those markets The French analysis goes further Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> s leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s policy of economic restructuring to succeed says Hubert Vedrine security adviser to Mr Mitterrand But they haven t yet drawn the operational policy conclusions He adds that with communism collapsing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy Our interest lies in a controlled transformation a contained nuclear reaction so we need to help him and not just with words Managing change he adds will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> especially in dealing with the question of German reunification Thierry de Montbrial director of the French Institutue for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> Relations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> says it isn t clear what exactly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> wants Any push for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> vision of a common European home implying the eventual dissolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> a Soviet German partnership and the withdrawal of U S forces would be a very very serious problem he says He doubts a Bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> but warns of a risk of profound change in the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> that is too strong even if democratic He adds We and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> have to talk to the Germans now frankly and raise these future risks with them While many commentators particularly French ones worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> or the speeded up withdrawal of American troops Mr Roper in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> sees a more positive scenario There seems to be a message from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> there s a deal on offer he says They want reassurance we won t try to undermine or destroy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> In return the U K and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> could keep their nuclear weapons He adds Once both sides feel comfortable it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>East</ENAMEX>
