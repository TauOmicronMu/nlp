Next to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts s megabillion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> deal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Television</ENAMEX> is small fry But the troubles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> are a classic tale of the leveraged buy out excesses of the 1980s especially the asset stripping game <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> which expects to release a plan to restructure 1 3 billion of debt in the next day or so isn t just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt though it did do that The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO a set of assets that were leveraged twice enabling the blue chip buy out king <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> in 1987 to take more than 1 billion of cash out of the com pany <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s buy out was an ace in the hole for Mr Kravis and for investors in KKR partnerships But it has left holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s junk bonds holding the bag including some heavyweights that KKR might need to finance future deals such as Kemper Financial Services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive Columbia</ENAMEX> Savings Loan and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> Some junk holders are said to be considering legal action against KKR or moves to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy court And KKR s majority partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville Tenn</ENAMEX> entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">George Gillett</ENAMEX> also is said to be very unhappy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s six stations once were part of Storer Communications KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy out then later sold Storer s cable operations at a fat profit In 1987 KKR for the second time piled debt onto Storer s TV stations selling them for 1 3 billion to a new entity that was 45 owned by KKR and 55 owned by Gillett Corp which now operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> stations In this second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBO KKR</ENAMEX> with one hand took more than 1 billion of cash out of the TV company s assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations making them more valuable in a 1988 sale Storer also took 125 million of junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds as partial payment for the TV assets With the other hand KKR put back into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> less than 10 of the cash it had taken out buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> common and preferred shares So while KKR today has an estimated 250 million sunk in now shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> including equity and debt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBO</ENAMEX> firm still is 1 billion ahead on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> buy out after taking cash up front On Storer as a whole KKR racked up compound annual returns of 60 in the three years it owned Storer Meanwhile Mr Gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about 100 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> if the company can t be restructured Overall Mr Gillett s holding company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillett Holdings</ENAMEX> is heavily indebted and except for its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vail Mountain</ENAMEX> resorts isn t doing very well With the TV business falling on hard times in recent years analysts say that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> had to be liquidated today it might fetch 30 less than in the 1987 buy out wiping out most of the company s junk holders and its stockholders Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can barely pay its cash interest bill and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s grace period for paying its bills is due to expire Nov 16 It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt Negotiations have started con structively but that s not to say we like this particular offer says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild Inc</ENAMEX> adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> junk holders No major player in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> deal will talk publicly But it s understood that Mr Kravis is disappointed that Mr Gillett didn t manage to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s operating profit after the buy out Mr Kravis apparently thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to sell assets to pay debt Mr Gillett is said to be proud of his operating record he has lifted some stations ratings and turned around a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> station As for junk holders they re discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR The bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R D Smith Co</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> which trades distressed securities People who have seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s restructuring plan say it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp They would both give part of their combined 50 million in common equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s 488 million of junk bonds as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company But some militant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> junk holders say that s not enough They contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s equity now is worthless They add that it isn t costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up front cash profit on the buy out which they think contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> s current problems Kemper the biggest holder of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds has refused to join the bond holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options To protect their claims some junk holders want KKR and perhaps Mr Gillett to invest new money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> perhaps 50 million or more One investment banker who isn t involved in the deal says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> needs at least 50 million of new equity to survive Junk holders say they have a stick to beat KKR with The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool to extract money from KKR says one big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> holder This could be the first major bankruptcy law proceeding for KKR he adds A big bankruptcy court case might tarnish KKR s name and provide new fuel for critics of Lbos in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and elsewhere But others say junk holders have nothing to gain by putting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy law proceedings While KKR doesn t control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Tvwhich</ENAMEX> is unusual for a KKR investment it clearly has much deeper pockets than Mr Gillett Bankruptcy specialists say Mr Kravis set a precedent for putting new money in sour Lbos recently when KKR restructured foundering Seaman Furniture doubling KKR s equity stake But with Seaman KKR was only trying to salvage its original investment says bankruptcy investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rubin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sass Lamle Rubin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> By contrast KKR probably has already made all the money it can on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> And people who know Mr Kravis say he isn t in a hurry to pour more money into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>TV</ENAMEX>
