And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie Jackson</ENAMEX> the retired baseball star has found another use for them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> who won the nickname Mr October for his World Series exploits is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as 500 each Dealers say the budding trade in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> s canceled checks is unusual I don t know of any living ballplayer that s ever done it says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> Smalling a dealer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ames Iowa</ENAMEX> and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs An initial batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> s checks was on sale at a baseball card show held in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Day</ENAMEX> weekend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well For someone who has everything else Reggie s jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says William Vizas owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> s Sports Collectibles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> who examined the checks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> card show For years the canceled checks of a small number of well known baseball players have been bought and sold But these players were dead Maybe three years ago there were a lot of Ty Cobbs in the hobby and awhile back there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Ruth</ENAMEX> checks says Mr Smalling However the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way Maybe I m a little stuffy but I wouldn t sell them sniffs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Machon</ENAMEX> owner of Papa s Sports Cards in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Menlo Park Calif Who</ENAMEX> knows how much they ll be worth 100 years from now And Mr Smalling doesn t believe they re worth all that much now I don t think the checks are worth 15 apiece he says Why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> who couldn t be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale isn t clear He probably hasn t done it for the cash I would say he s definitely not in need of money says Matt Merola an agent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> s based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> He has good investments And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> probably has opened new checking accounts too Or at least he should I assume those accounts are closed says Mr Smalling referring to the accounts of the canceled checks I don t think he d want to give out his current account numbers
