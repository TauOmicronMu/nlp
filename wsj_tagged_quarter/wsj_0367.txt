Every workday at 11 a m 40 year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Sinyard</ENAMEX> dons cycling clothes hops on a bike he keeps at his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morgan Hill Calif</ENAMEX> office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car As many as 50 of his employees at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized Bicycle Components Inc</ENAMEX> ride with him When they return to their desks at 1 p m they have pedaled 20 miles Such fervor for cycling helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> build a creative company at the forefront of its industry Founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> spotted the appeal of fat tired bikes that go almost anywhere and began mass producing them in 1981 In the past five years the company s sales have grown to 80 million from 26 million Today so called mountain bikes account for two thirds of the 2 billion spent annually on all bicycles in the U S With 65 of its sales coming from mountain bikes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> is widely considered to be a market leader <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Accessories</ENAMEX> largely for mountain bike users account for much of the rest of sales But today the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> helped create turning out mountain bikes with such well known names as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schwinn Peugeot Raleigh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishiki Thus Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> s company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them by developing new products specifically for mountain biking At the same time though it must become more structured to better manage its growth Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle It is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast especially when their success attracts big time competitors The big word around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> is passion says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erik Eidsmo</ENAMEX> a former ski industry executive whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> to run marketing and sales What I hope to bring to this is another word process That s my challenge It s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> s challenge as well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Eidsmo</ENAMEX> is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the free wheeling fast growing company under tighter control We had a lot of problems <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> says While the company s sales were soaring We still had a system that was probably appropriate for 10 million to 20 million in sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adds Mr Eidsmo</ENAMEX> What felt good that day was done that day Since his arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">May Mr Eidsmo</ENAMEX> has put in place techniques learned while working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> such as management by objective detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends We re finally getting and it s been very painful some understanding of what the company s long term horizon should begin to look like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Eidsmo</ENAMEX> says But it s risky he says of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> s attempt to adopt a corporate structure You don t want to lose the magic of the company s creative drive Hoping to stay ahead of the pack the company is emphasizing innovation At a recent trade show convention goers lined up to view a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> bike frame that weighs just 2 7 pounds a pound less than the lightest mountain bike frame on the market By replacing the frame s steel lugs with titanium ones <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> s company plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter At the trade show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> also unveiled a revolutionary three spoked bike wheel developed jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont Co Made</ENAMEX> of space age materials the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave 10 minutes off the time of a rider in a 100 mile race the company claims It currently costs 750 though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between 200 and 250 He was able to slash the price of the company s least expensive mountain bike to 279 from 750 in But demands on the company s creativity are certain to grow Competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain bike market <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> s company once had virtually all to itself U S Cycling Federation official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Milburn</ENAMEX> says mountain biking is growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this One especially coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> market the new players are targeting is mountain bike accessories which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Eidsmo</ENAMEX> calls the future of our business Accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25 to 30 or so on sales of complete cycles To get a piece of the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike Inc Beaverton Ore</ENAMEX> introduced a line of mountain bike shoes About a month ago <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michelin Tire Corp Greenville S C</ENAMEX> began selling mountain bike tires for years a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> stronghold Competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trek Bicycle Corp</ENAMEX> which accounts for one quarter of the 400 million in annual sales at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> based parent Intrepid Corp entered the mountain bike business in 1983 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trek</ENAMEX> previously made only traditional road bikes but it didn t take a rocket scientist to change a road bike into a mountain bike says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trek s</ENAMEX> president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Burke</ENAMEX> The segment now makes up roughly two thirds of his company s total sales At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Bicycle Inc Rancho Dominguez Calif</ENAMEX> sales have tripled since the company entered the U S mountain bike business in 1987 A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world wide sales of 150 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> is one example of the sudden globalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> s once cozy market niche <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schwinn Bicycle Co Chicago</ENAMEX> established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> to sell bikes In the past year <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Derby International Corp Luxembourg</ENAMEX> has acquired such major brands as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peugeot Raleigh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nishiki</ENAMEX> In response to the internationalization of the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sinyard</ENAMEX> s company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> more control over marketing and sales But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill Austin Giant</ENAMEX> s president puts it With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength the game has changed
