Some important people plan to gather here soon to say nice things about Brian P Monieson The occasion isn t a tribute to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> chairman however but a hearing at which federal commodity regulators hope to ban him from the futures industry The Commodity Futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trading Commission</ENAMEX> alleges that Mr Monieson was warned that some brokers at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP Commodities Inc</ENAMEX> were bilking investors and that he failed to stop them promptly One of the brokers in question was one of Mr Monieson s best friends The case has become the most closely watched civil commodity enforcement action in recent memory with the futures industry s top officials rallying to Mr Monieson s defense His scheduled character witnesses at the Nov 6 hearing include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter</ENAMEX> who was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> president under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson Leo Melamed</ENAMEX> chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc s</ENAMEX> executive committee and Robert K Wilmouth president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Futures Association</ENAMEX> an industry funded regulatory group Mr Monieson s attorney in the matter is Jerrold E Salzman the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> s influential outside counsel The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> brokers allegedly allocated trades meaning they initiated futures trades without the required customer account numbers and then kept the profitable ones for themselves and stuck customers with the losers Mr Monieson a childhood math whiz and self described computer nerd denies these charges and expects that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> will be exonerated Noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> processed some nine million trades last year he says Who the heck would know what s going on with 50 trades out of nine million If he loses at the hearing Mr Monieson can appeal to the full panel of CFTC commissioners and then to the federal courts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs Melamed Salzman</ENAMEX> and Wilmouth came to their friend s aid despite the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Futures Association</ENAMEX> brought similar failure to supervise charges against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> though not against Mr Monieson personally To some the case shows the fallacy of self regulation a concept the futures industry cherishes In theory traders and brokers will police themselves because widespread fraud would discredit the industry and frighten away investors This enlightened self interest is supposed to overcome the built in conflicts of interest The problem with self regulation is always that the regulators are tinged with self interest says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX> the just departed chairman of the Securities and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> In this case Mr Ruder says it would seem they re acting in two capacities that people of that stature would testify in a disciplinary case One would counsel the avoidance of an appearance of a conflict Mr Ruder adds of Mr Yeutter It seems odd that people in high government positions would intervene to testify Mr Salzman says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> gave him permission to represent Mr Monieson adding there s no conflict because he has recused himself from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> s case I ve had a long personal relationship with Brian Mr Salzman says I couldn t say no Mr Melamed and Mr Wilmouth both said they see no conflict because their organizations didn t charge Mr Monieson personally and they re only testifying to his character Mr Yeutter couldn t be reached for comment In an interview in his corner office in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> tower Mr Monieson contends he is a victim of his own celebrity The CFTC was looking for something high profile he says The investigation already has been costly to Mr Monieson In January 1987 he was two weeks away from the sale of his firm for as much as 40 million But the deal hit a snag The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> which had to approve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> s sale to Banque Indosuez a French bank learned of the CFTC investigation A distressed Mr Monieson called the CFTC and asked its two top lawyers no fewer than five times to divulge confidential details of its probe into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> They refused even after Mr Monieson warned that the deal s collapse would become an international incident between the U S and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> according to a memo one of the lawyers wrote The Banque Indosuez deal fell through Mr Monieson 53 years old wears the expensive clothes of a successful trader but his mannerisms are more those of a preoccupied math professor His office is filled with toy pigs to remind him of the fortune he made trading pork bellies And behind his desk hangs a more recent sign of success a futures trader s Picasso a Leroy Nieman painting depicting a horse race Mr Monieson s defense at the CFTC hearing will partly be that he is a busy man and wasn t personally involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> s retail brokerage business During his years as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> chairman 1983 through 1985 Mr Monieson played host to prime ministers and crown princes his attorneys have prepared charts showing the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> meetings he attended and the time he spent away on business The lawyers probably won t mention his interest in horse racing though Mr Monieson says it remains a hobby Mr Monieson born on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Side</ENAMEX> by age five was a faithful reader of the Racing Form regularly joining his father at the track he says Later he bet the ponies with a high school friend Myron Rosenthal who would become his partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> and other ventures In 1965 he and Mr Rosenthal set up what would become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indecon Inc</ENAMEX> a computer processing firm An early offshoot was their computerized tip sheet for harness racing cranked out using the same type of equipment used in important space research and big business Mr Monieson told subscribers Programming unexpectedly led him into trading in the early 1970s when a customer a pork processor commissioned a computer program on the supply and demand of bacon but never used the program Mr Monieson and Mr Rosenthal got together 50 000 and started trading pork belly futures at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> based on the program s predictions They formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> in 1973 not out of any desire to run a futures clearing firm Mr Monieson says but because they were tired of paying brokerage commissions A decade later <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> was trading all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> floor mostly in financial futures Yet pork bellies still held a fascination for Mr Monieson and his trading in that pit would earn him a dubious distinction the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> chairman to be found guilty of committing trading violations while running the exchange Mr Monieson and Mr Rosenthal were fined 10 000 and 70 000 respectively for taking speculative positions beyond the exchange s limits Mr Rosenthal s fine was bigger because he allegedly had exceeded position limits before Mr Monieson likening the fine to a parking ticket says he did violate the rules but contends the position limits are set too low for today s trading environment Three associates held pork belly positions nearly identical to those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> owners and appeared to be acting at their direction according to an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> account of the case A company controlled by Mr Monieson and Mr Rosenthal lent the other traders more than 6 5 million to help finance the trades One of the associates was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Furlett</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> salesman and one of Mr Monieson s closest friends Mr Furlett s job was to call up investors and get them to trade futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> got a commission Ira P Greenspon was in the same line of work and in October 1985 joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> didn t know was that Mr Greenspon already was under investigation by the CFTC for alleged trade allocating at his previous firm The CFTC later concluded that Mr Furlett had been allocating trades as well According to separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> charges against the two men and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> which haven t been made public during the first two months of 1986 accounts they maintained including one named Horse Trading had profits of 62 372 95 Four customer accounts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> reviewed had combined losses of 20 988 12 for those months Robert L Sutermeister a retired trucking company owner in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton Ohio</ENAMEX> says he lost nearly all of the 10 000 he sent the brokers Larry Margler a Mckinleyville Ca engineer says he lost about 3 000 of the 5 000 he turned over to Mr Furlett Between June 1985 and May 1986 the CFTC alleges Mr Monieson was warned by at least five <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> employees that Mr Furlett and Mr Greenspon were defrauding customers After the Banque Indosuez deal collapsed in January 1987 the two salesmen left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP Their</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Koch</ENAMEX> says they deny any wrongdoing and that both men have agreed to leave the futures industry
