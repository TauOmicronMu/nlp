Hospital Regulation Sparks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Feud WHICH</ENAMEX> IS the best medicine for runaway health costs competition or regulation The question is at the root of a brawl between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana Inc</ENAMEX> the big for profit hospital and insurance company and its not for profit brethren in its home state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> The battle focuses on the state s certificate of need law which regulates investment in new medical technology The law has prevented 216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986 according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S Conn</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Hospital Association</ENAMEX> But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Jones Humana</ENAMEX> s chief executive it promotes technology monopolies stifles innovation and raises prices If the Legislature doesn t repeal the law due for revision in 1990 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jones</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana</ENAMEX> may move its insurance operations including 3 000 jobs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> to another state The company complains that it paid 10 million to non <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana</ENAMEX> hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided to its insurance plan members But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana</ENAMEX> says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Conn</ENAMEX> charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana</ENAMEX> s own actions undermine its argument When a hospital in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lexington</ENAMEX> installed a lithotripter last year demand for a similar kidney stone smashing machine at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana</ENAMEX> hospital in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> fell 34 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana</ENAMEX> hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Conn</ENAMEX> says and now charges as much as 8 000 for the procedure which costs only about 3 500 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lexington Humana</ENAMEX> contends that 8 000 represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is 4 900 Meanwhile another hospital s proposal for a new generation lithotripter is pending before the board that administers the certificate of need law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humana</ENAMEX> which wants to acquire one of the new machines itself is on the record as opposed to the proposal Debt Burdened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doctors Seek Financial Security HEALTH CARE</ENAMEX> experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high paying specialties instead of primary care where more physicians are needed most Now there s a new wrinkle in what young doctors want More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they d prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee for service compensation in their first professional position And 81 preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization while just 11 favored solo practice Ten years ago a physician would go to a town and take out a loan to start a practice says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Merritt</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merritt Hawkins</ENAMEX> Associates an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irvine Calif</ENAMEX> physician recruiter that conducted the survey They won t do that very often today at all They re looking for something that s very safe The numbers behind such fears The average debt of medical school graduates who borrowed to pay for their education jumped 10 to 42 374 this year from 38 489 in 1988 says the Association of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical Colleges That</ENAMEX> s 115 more than in 1981 Money isn t the only reason for the shift in practice preferences It reflects values of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H Moxley III</ENAMEX> who directs physician executive searches for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korn Ferry International</ENAMEX> This is a change in the social fabric of medicine he says Related Roommates Trim Hospital Bills <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WHEN Catherine Bobar</ENAMEX> spent several weeks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont</ENAMEX> recently with a bone infection in her toe she shared a room just like most patients But unlike most patients her roommate was her husband It was certainly good to have him handy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Bobar</ENAMEX> says The 12 bed cooperative care unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J Grieco</ENAMEX> medical director of cooperative care at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York University Medical Center</ENAMEX> where the concept began 10 years ago It helps us and them while they re here and it certainly makes them a better health care team when they get home It also saves money Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff room charges are lower about 100 less per day than a regular room at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont</ENAMEX> hospital Cancer patients needing prolonged radiation therapy diabetics learning to manage their blood sugar levels and cardiac bypass patients are among those who spend time on cooperative care units The approach has generated so much interest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYU</ENAMEX> is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov 30 It s really part of the hospital of the 21st century <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Grieco</ENAMEX> says Odds and Ends THE CHIEF NURSING officer can be responsible for more than 1 000 employees and at least one third of a hospital s budget a head nurse typically oversees up to 80 employees and 8 million So says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Fund</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> philanthropist that s sponsoring a 1 million project to develop joint masters in business and nursing programs at 10 universities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meharry Medical College</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville Tenn</ENAMEX> launches a new research publication in the spring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> on Health Care for the Poor and <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Underserved</ENAMEX>
