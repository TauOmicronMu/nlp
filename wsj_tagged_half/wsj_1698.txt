Watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors fighting the urge to spend more we re reminded of those late night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says Stop me before I kill again The Members know they re doing wrong but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arkansas Democrat David Pryor</ENAMEX> spilled his guts on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor the other day after he d joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> s early morning pork barrel revels I must tell you I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter It was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy He was turning himself in Frankly as I was walking back to get in my car I heard many many people opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in he said As I was driving home I did not feel very good about myself We can applaud <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pryor</ENAMEX> s moment of epiphany even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again A good place to start the rehabilitation is a legislative line item veto bill now being offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana Senator Dan Coats</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coats</ENAMEX> bill which already has 32 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> co sponsors isn t a pure line item veto because it would apply only to spending bills Instead it s a form of enhanced rescission giving a President a chance to rescind or strike specific spending items that just go too far Under the proposal a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of rescissions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> once when he proposes his budget and again after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> disposes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50 majority but then a President could veto that rejection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would then need the usual two thirds majority to override any veto The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget Reform Act</ENAMEX> Before 1974 a President could impound or refuse to spend funds appropriated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> Presidents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> were both big users of the impoundment power but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> saw its chance against a weakened <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Nixon</ENAMEX> and stripped it away Today a President can still send up spending rescissions but they re meaningless unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has a guilty conscience and changes its mind This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens and naturally rescissions are almost never approved In 1987 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Reagan</ENAMEX> sent 73 rescissions back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> but only 3 of the spending total was approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Senator Coats</ENAMEX> s proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> acts The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special interest goodies but the police in the form of a President would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy as they do now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Coats</ENAMEX> plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> has endorsed the idea and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past We re told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senator Pryor</ENAMEX> isn t yet a co sponsor but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions they ll sign up
