In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars a lot of revenue desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space So can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers Garbage magazine billed as The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Practical Journal</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment</ENAMEX> is about to find out Founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn N Y</ENAMEX> publishing entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Poore Garbage</ENAMEX> made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U S waste crisis The magazine combines how to pieces on topics like backyard composting explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet and hard hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> s good guys and bad boys In one feature called In the Dumpster editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender From an advertising standpoint the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days With only two issues under its belt Garbage has alienated some would be advertisers and raised the ire of others <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> for one is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere In the Dumpster column The magazine s editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging s polystyrene foam polyproplene and polyester film all plastic items they say are non biodegradable It s precisely the kind of product that s created the municipal landfill monster the editors wrote I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage but it is practicing journalistic garbage fumes a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> wasn t even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed he says making it less an offender than was portrayed He admits though it isn t one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> s better products in terms of recyclability <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> not surprisingly doesn t have any plans to advertise in the magazine according to its spokesman Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison Avenue</ENAMEX> s big spenders You really need the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soups</ENAMEX> of the world to be interested in your magazine if you re going to make a run of it says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike White</ENAMEX> senior vice president and media director at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DDB Needham Chicago</ENAMEX> The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base of big time ad spenders he adds The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors</ENAMEX> but the majority were from companies like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waste Management Inc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bumkins International</ENAMEX> firms that don t spend much money advertising and can t be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Waste Management</ENAMEX> spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one time purchase and it doesn t have any plans to advertise in future issues We don t spend much on print advertising she says But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Poore</ENAMEX> the magazine s editor and publisher contends Garbage can survive at least initially on subscription revenues <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual</ENAMEX> copies of the magazine sell for 2 95 and yearly subscriptions cost 21 It is of course printed on recycled paper According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ms Poore Old House Journal Corp</ENAMEX> her publishing company printed and sold all 126 000 copies of the premiere issue The first and second issues sold out on newsstands she says and the magazine has orders for 93 000 subscriptions Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine s direct policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Poore</ENAMEX> replies I don t know and I don t care I m not saying advertising revenue isn t important she says but I couldn t sleep at night if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad Ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notes INTERPUBLIC ON TV Interpublic Group</ENAMEX> said its television programming operations which it expanded earlier this
