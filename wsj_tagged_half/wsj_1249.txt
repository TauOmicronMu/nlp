TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> really cared about fair employment after what they said was eight years of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> era neglect was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females blacks and other minorities The perception lingers says an official at a major industrial company But so far he declares there s little evidence the new urgency is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity he asks The recruiting hasn t materialized asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Christian</ENAMEX>
