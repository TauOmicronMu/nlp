Canadian dollars US 666 million to acquire the company The board said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb</ENAMEX> are negotiating financing before offering C 16 40 a share to acquire all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> s shares outstanding The directors added that the two executives haven t reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders The directors said if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Drabinsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX> mail an offer to shareholders by Nov 22 it will reimburse them a maximum of C 8 5 million for expenses related to a bid We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Kolber</ENAMEX> spokeswoman for the independent directors committee appointed last May to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> s major shareholder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc MCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> s other major shareholder <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> based financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bronfman</ENAMEX> and his associates have agreed

TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> s equity and 33 of its voting rights through restricted voting shares while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronfman</ENAMEX> interests hold about 24 of the company s equity <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Kolber</ENAMEX> said the committee had received other bids She declined to identify other bidders but said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> s offer is all cash and it s for all of the company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Several Cineplex</ENAMEX> analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company All this has really established is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> and the Bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffery Logsdon</ENAMEX> an analyst with Crowell Weedon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> If a bid materializes at that price shareholders will have every reason to be glad but the question of financing still remains Last <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">April Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30 2 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> for C 17 50 NNP a share from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronfman</ENAMEX> associates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years said the purchase subsequently rejected by regulators was aimed at consolidating his control of the company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> strongly opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drabinsky</ENAMEX> group s move The directors didn t indicate the source of financing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> s new proposal but said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronfman</ENAMEX> associates agreed in principle to buy for 57 million and then lease back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> its 18 screen theater complex in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Universal City Calif</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> succeeds in an offer This is being done at the suggestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> and to accommodate him to facilitate his financing arrangements <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Kolber</ENAMEX> said In addition the directors said if a bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drabinsky</ENAMEX> is successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cineplex</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank Organisation
