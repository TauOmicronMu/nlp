Just five months after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Group</ENAMEX> was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenneth Roman Ogilvy</ENAMEX> s chairman and chief executive officer said he is leaving to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co Mr Roman</ENAMEX> 59 years old abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency whose largest client is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> s executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications He will succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry L Freeman</ENAMEX> 57 who has said he will retire in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">December Mr Freeman</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> that he would retire by the end of this year to take executive responsibility for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edmond Safra American Express</ENAMEX> representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr Safra The company later apologized and agreed to make 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Freeman</ENAMEX> is retiring he will continue to work as a consultant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> on a project basis Ad industry executives weren t surprised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> s decision to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> The agency under his direction bitterly fought a takeover attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> before succumbing in May And although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> s chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sorrell</ENAMEX> have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other people close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> say he was unhappy giving up control of the company Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr Sorrell a financial man to cut costs at the agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> will be succeeded as the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> s flagship ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Mather Worldwide</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> 50 who had been president of North American operations and who like Mr Sorrell is British Alexander Brody 56 will take on the newly created position of president of the world wide agency and chief executive of its international operations He had been president of the international operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> also had overseen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Group</ENAMEX> s two other units the Scali Mccabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division but those units will now report directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WPP Mr Roman</ENAMEX> appears custom made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> job Known as a traditional executive he is very much in the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> mold Moreover after 26 years at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> he had honed a reputation for being squeaky clean and a straight arrow which can only help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> in the wake of the Safra incident He also is close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> s chairman and chief executive officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D Robinson III Aside</ENAMEX> from working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Robinson</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> advertising account for about 11 years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> serves on several of the same charities and boards as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Robinson</ENAMEX> The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> had been pushed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> s top spot by Mr Sorrell But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> flatly denied the speculation saying Mr Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine The wine naturally was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> s brand an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> client He asked me not to resign The implication that I was pushed aside wouldn t be accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> said Mr Sorrell traveling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> couldn t be reached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Robinson</ENAMEX> first approached him about the job in late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> According to industry executives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sutherland</ENAMEX> a former European Community commissioner from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> was also a serious contender for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> job Although it ultimately wasn t offered to him he will be on retainer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> as an adviser on international matters After talking on and off for the past four weeks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> said he agreed to take the job because it s the right time it s a terrific opportunity and I think I leave the company in very strong hands It was my decision not anyone else s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> his successor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> The two executives could hardly be more different <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> comes across as a low key executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> has a flashier personality During time off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> tends to his garden <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> confesses to a fondness for among other things fast cars and planes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry</ENAMEX> executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover brought them closer together I m the guy who made him head of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> head of the U S president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> and recommended him to Mr Sorrell as my successor Would I have done all those things successively if I didn t think he was the right guy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> asked He labeled reports of friction ridiculous and said that he spent part of the weekend on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> s boat in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut Mr Roman</ENAMEX> will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> s public relations and government affairs among other things but he won t be involved in its advertising which is handled by the operating units I consider this a second career he said He also will sit on the company s corporate planning and policy committee made up of the top corporate and operating executives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> s departure isn t expected to have any enormous repercussions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy American Express Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> executives said the move won t affect their relationships with the ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX> s relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies work and will continue to be said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hurwitt</ENAMEX> a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> But some clients and analysts expressed concern that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> isn t as well known to many clients Ken was my key contact said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J Nicholas Hahn</ENAMEX> president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton Inc</ENAMEX> which represents cotton producers I don t know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> all that well I haven t seen or talked to him in several years And some analysts questioned whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> would have the skills <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> needs to turn the agency around While the agency has done well in many parts of the world its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office has had a dismal track record recently it has won few new accounts while losing big ones including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> is going to need some help I think they need creative leadership and I don t think they have it said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma Hill</ENAMEX> an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim Co Ogilvy Mather</ENAMEX> s top creative executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Berry</ENAMEX> left the agency earlier this year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Berry</ENAMEX> was a creative inspiration at the company and nobody has filled that void said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Hill</ENAMEX> But other analysts said that having <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Phillips</ENAMEX> succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roman</ENAMEX> would make for a smooth transition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> has been there a long time knows the culture well is aggressive and apparently gets along well with Mr Sorrell said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Wallach</ENAMEX> an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> It s probably a reasonable transition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopefully</ENAMEX> he ll be the answer to the problems they ve had in <ENAMEX
