<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s Daiwa Securities Co named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masahiro Dozen</ENAMEX> president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> succeeds Sadakane Doi who will become vice chairman Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Daiwa Japan</ENAMEX> s second largest securities firm In Japanese firms the president usually is in charge of day to day operations while the chairman s role is more a ceremonial one The title of chief executive officer isn t used While people within Daiwa particularly internationalists expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> 52 would eventually become Daiwa s president the speed of his promotion surprised many It was only earlier this year that the jovial easygoing executive he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve was appointed deputy president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing Daiwa is one of the world s largest securities firms As of March 31 the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801 21 billion yen 5 64 billion For the six months ended Sept 30 Daiwa reported unconsolidated parent company net income of 79 03 billion yen 556 5 million on revenue of 332 38 billion yen 2 34 billion Both figures were record highs Several observers interpreted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> s appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s domestic markets which should mean increased competition All of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s so called Big Four securities firms <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co Ltd</ENAMEX> the world s largest Nikko Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co Ltd Yamaichi</ENAMEX> Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co Ltd</ENAMEX> and Daiwa have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed income securities in the Eurobond market mostly for Japanese firms they have been only marginally profitable if at all in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S American</ENAMEX> institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U S shares in the past several months they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors At the same time Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well entrenched American competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to U S corporations and institutional investors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> knows these problems firsthand When he arrived in the U S in 1969 the start of an eight year tour he tried selling Japanese yen denominated bonds to U S investors He made desperate efforts using the yellow pages from beginning to end said Koji Yoneyama president of Daiwa s U S unit But not a single piece of paper was sold By his own account <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> didn t do much better with U S bonds In an interview a few months ago he recalled how after some training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc</ENAMEX> he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U S corporate bond issues But he couldn t sell any Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds Maybe it s crazy he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> shore and caught nothing Upon returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Exhausted I got into a taxicab and the woman driver said Americans make better fishermen he recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Undaunted Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> said that Daiwa s goal is to build a high technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures options mortgaged backed securities computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> said Daiwa s strengths were its large capital base its influential position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> joined Daiwa upon his graduation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto University</ENAMEX> in 1959 Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms he began his career peddling stock to individual investors In his climb to the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> also headed the company s stock exchange division its fixed income units and its international operations He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience he is very well balanced said Takuro Isoda chairman of Daiwa s U S unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> But it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> s experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support particularly from the retail sales force to accede to the presidency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies earnings And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force would be fragile said a Daiwa executive If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dozen</ENAMEX> has a weakness it may be his golf game He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball like a farmer said Mr <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Yoneyama</ENAMEX>
