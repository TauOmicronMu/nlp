<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Singer Bette Midler</ENAMEX> won a 400 000 federal court jury verdict against Young Rubicam in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using sound alike performers to tout products The decision in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> federal court stems from a 1985 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury Sable</ENAMEX> TV ad that Young Rubicam worked up for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co</ENAMEX> The ad agency had approached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Midler</ENAMEX> about appearing but she declined citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work The agency then turned to a former backup singer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Midler</ENAMEX> who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Midler</ENAMEX> s 1973 hit song Do You Wanna Dance The appeals court held When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs The judge in the jury trial said there was insufficient evidence to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> liable in the case In a statement Young Rubicam called the award unfortunate but bearable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Laird</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Midler</ENAMEX> said We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies can not with impunity imitate the voices of well known performers That is a property right that belongs to the performer The award although far less than the 10 million including punitive damages that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Midler</ENAMEX> sought is likely to force <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison Avenue</ENAMEX> to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads Last year s appeals court decision for instance spawned several suits reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Darin</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX> s Corp over its Mac Tonight TV commercials a rough parody of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Darin</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mack</ENAMEX> the Knife trademark The appeals court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Sinatra</ENAMEX> and a tire ad also a Young Rubicam product <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Sinatra</ENAMEX> sued over the use of her These Boots are Made for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walkin</ENAMEX> song in the ad At that time the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> coming up with a statement that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Sinatra</ENAMEX> is not distinctive but that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bette Midler</ENAMEX> is I am not sure that judges many of whom I like very much are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kurnit</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> advertising lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nonetheless Mr Kurnit</ENAMEX> said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanne Lipman</ENAMEX> contributed to this article
