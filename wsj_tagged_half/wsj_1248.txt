A 320 million 508 million British Airways PLC rights issue flopped badly the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy out bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Airlines parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> carrier had planned the issue to help finance its 750 million purchase of a 15 stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> withdrew from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> labor management buy out plan last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> after the group failed to get bank financing for its 6 79 billion buy out British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6 3 of the convertible capital bonds but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters Analysts said that 6 3 level marked the poorest showing for any major British rights issue since the 1987 global stock market crash It is close to being a record undersubscription said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Bucknell</ENAMEX> an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> broker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith New Court</ENAMEX> Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fund</ENAMEX> managers don t like to have rights issues that don t have an obvious reason The obvious reason was for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Air</ENAMEX> to buy a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Airlines In a statement <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Air Chairman Lord King</ENAMEX> said the company was obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue But except for the embarrassment British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers Co will pick up the rest of the airline s offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub underwriting the issue among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> institutional investors The paper loss here is very small for these sub underwriters observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nelson</ENAMEX> a Lazard managing director In any case he added most institutions probably won t sell the bonds And instead of buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stake the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest From a cash flow point of view <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> is better off not being in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Airlines in the short term said Andy Chambers an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London Added</ENAMEX> another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> analyst It gives them some cash in the back pocket for when they want to do something For instance <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Air</ENAMEX> is continuing to negotiate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines about each acquiring a 20 stake in Sabena World Airlines the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline A definitive agreement had been expected by the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> The failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Air</ENAMEX> shares The airline s share price already is far below the 210 pence 3 33 level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> In late trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday the shares were off three pence at 194 pence And because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Air</ENAMEX> is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares the share price won t be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Air</ENAMEX> s withdrawal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy out could have further repercussions Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split which may lead to the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Colin Marshall</ENAMEX> the carrier s chief executive officer The stories are rubbish a British Air spokesman said There is no difference of opinion between Chairman Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy
