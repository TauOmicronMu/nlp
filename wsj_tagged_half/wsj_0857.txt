government control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deltacorp</ENAMEX> the holding company that owns the thrift contends that the federal law empowering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> to place failing savings and loan associations under government control conflicts with the federal bankruptcy law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chapter Deltacorp</ENAMEX> has a bankruptcy petition pending in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> The company is scheduled to appear before federal bankruptcy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Tina L Brozman Thursday</ENAMEX> to ask her to impose a 60 day preliminary injunction on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> of Thrift Supervision the enforcement arm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC Deltacorp</ENAMEX> hopes within 60 days it will be able to sell the thrift says its lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David M Friedman</ENAMEX> a partner with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Hurwitz Butowsky Weitzen Shalov Wein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deltacorp</ENAMEX> prevails similarly situated companies will be able to use Chapter 11 to thwart <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> s program to restructure the trouble S L industry Under Chapter 11 a company operates under protection from creditors lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts Passed early this year the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act authorizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> to declare troubled thrift institutions insolvent and place them in receivership The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> can then close the thrift institution and sell it whole or in parts Established three months ago the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> has taken over 256 thrifts valued at 95 6 billion The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> was on the verge of placing Colonial Savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselle N J</ENAMEX> a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deltacorp</ENAMEX> into receivership This week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deltacorp</ENAMEX> persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Brozman</ENAMEX> to issue a temporary restraining order arguing that before its thrift was taken over the apparent conflict between the two federal laws should be resolved According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Friedman</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> s pending takeover would impair the company s ability under Chapter 11 to recoup loses by putting its subsidiary up for bid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Friedman</ENAMEX> claims <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deltacorp</ENAMEX> estimates that by selling the thrift it could make about 23 million If the government sells the thrift the company will make far less he contends If the court were to issue the injunction it would set a significant precedent says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Friedman</ENAMEX> who says he doesn t know how many other companies are in a position to use the bankruptcy law as a shelter against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> takeovers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Kowalski</ENAMEX> a partner with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parker Chapin Flattau Klimpl</ENAMEX> who has clients in situations similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deltacorp</ENAMEX> says lawyers

about criminal activities would never be published if criminals couldn t be paid for their stories and that this had a chilling effect on the publishing industry But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge
