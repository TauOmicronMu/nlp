over the so called sick building syndrome Plaintiffs lawyers say that buildings become sick when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside Anthony J Iaciofano a lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burlington</ENAMEX> said the company believes the Beebes symptoms were not related to the carpeting He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes symptoms appeared months later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Adams</ENAMEX> the Beebes lawyer said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case she said The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting But the Beebes didn t come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Adams</ENAMEX> said The Beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback The Appellate Division of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York State Supreme Court</ENAMEX> dismissed six lawsuits attempting to block a 2 5 billion project planned for 42nd Street in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan

Realty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was significant litigation pending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer</ENAMEX> said the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a 155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs Also he said the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division s ruling will be appealed The plan which has been plagued with delays and business related setbacks seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to

<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> yesterday retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Lewis Powell</ENAMEX> contested the notion that the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> term marked a turn toward conservatism Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a shift in direction on the court I take these pronouncements like many that have
