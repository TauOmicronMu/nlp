It has more drug users than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> has people Thirty four thousand of its children live in foster homes while 50 000 residents have no homes at all Its tax base is shrinking a 1 billion budget deficit looms and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year This is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> When the dust and dirt settle in an extra nasty mayoral race the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> Running the nation s largest and most ornery city may be no treat but at least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> knows what to expect from it As the campaign hits the home stretch however voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him After 25 years in city politics <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> remains an enigma The soft spoken silver haired <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president the first black man to win the Democratic nomination for mayor here doesn t have a single prominent political enemy While he is widely described as a man with deep convictions he has few major political programs that he can call his own Asked about his greatest achievement in public life he first speaks about the quality of his staff Now as election day nears even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoralty on Nov 7 They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies including union leaders and political cronies who may seek a place at the trough They wonder whether he has the economic know how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis and they wonder who will be advising him Will he if he wins be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings or will he tilt toward the real estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign After his decisive primary victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Edward</ENAMEX> I <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">September Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> coasted until recently on a quite comfortable lead over his Republican opponent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> the former crime buster who has proved a something of a bust as a candidate But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> has stumbled in the past two weeks over his campaign s payments to a black activist who is a convicted kidnapper and over his handling of a stock sale to his son Polls also have recorded some slippage in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s support among Jewish voters and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage points In an interview with reporters and editors of The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall Street Journal Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty A lot of people think I will give away the store but I can assure you I will not he says I am aware we have real budgetary problems The city is full of aging bridges water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair Renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly But city officials say tax revenues are lagging And after a decade of explosive job growth on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> a period of contraction is under way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Koch</ENAMEX> already has announced he will drop 3 200 jobs from the city payroll but that won t be enough <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York State Comptroller Edward Regan</ENAMEX> predicts a 1 3 billion budget gap for the city s next fiscal year a gap that could grow if there is a recession If elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under serviced neighborhoods He is going to face a mess says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council President Andrew Stein</ENAMEX> His supporters are not venal but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he won t have any money By and large <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore Instead of focusing on the financial future <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Koch</ENAMEX> The thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer Frucher</ENAMEX> a real estate executive and former aide to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gov Mario Cuomo</ENAMEX> It is a feel good candidacy No doubt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> has been a calming influence He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody More important he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Park</ENAMEX> rape of a white jogger in which a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlem</ENAMEX> teens was charged and the racial murder of a black teen ager in the white <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bensonhurst Rather</ENAMEX> than scaring off white voters as many predicted he would Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head Keeping cool is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> priority On humid days this summer he was known to change his double breasted suits as many as four times a day But even in his front runner campaign he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president and might hinder him as mayor Over the last few weeks he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33 point lead in the polls over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani A</ENAMEX> story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy Sutton</ENAMEX> was allowed to fester a full week before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> faced the media He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke His campaign was caught flat footed amid allegations it paid almost 10 000 for what it said was a get out the vote effort by black activist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonny Carson</ENAMEX> a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is anti white Critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> camp to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Carson</ENAMEX> to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX> murder protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> also has failed to allay Jewish voters fears about his association with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX> despite the fact that few local non Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> has These campaign problems have echoed difficulties <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> has run into before A former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S Marine Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> got off to a quick start in politics joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s linking up with black urban leaders such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Rangel Basil Paterson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sutton</ENAMEX> and getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965 But his chance to become deputy mayor under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Abraham Beame</ENAMEX> a plan boosted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sutton</ENAMEX> was squandered because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s failure still largely unexplained to file income tax returns for four years running I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow he said at the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Later Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> became more deeply indebted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sutton</ENAMEX> and other city pols including then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council President Paul O Dwyer</ENAMEX> when they helped him get appointed city clerk a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city s marriage bureau among other things Mr O Dwyer is now one of the lawyers for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sutton</ENAMEX> s media company The debt rose further in 1977 when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sutton</ENAMEX> resigned his position as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president to run for mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sutton</ENAMEX> recalls When I left I sat down with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Rangel Basil Paterson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> said Who will run for borough president And I said You will <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Garth Mayor Koch</ENAMEX> s longtime media adviser says of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> He really is the personification of the patronage system But the guy is so personally decent people tend to forget that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in 1985 But by most accounts he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s Board</ENAMEX> of Estimate the body that votes on crucial budget and land use matters Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss en masse certain controversial proposals He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a m I ll give him that says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard Often Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out critics claim On the campaign stump he often points out that he was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real estate project at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Columbus Circle</ENAMEX> But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position Says one city official Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bronx Borough President Ferdinand Ferrer</ENAMEX> was said to be so impatient with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ferrer</ENAMEX> admits but he maintains that he didn t delay his support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> and that he backs the Democratic candidate enthusiastically <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s campaign manager and former chief of staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Lynch</ENAMEX> denies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> borough president has taken too long to decide important issues We didn t rubber stamp everything that came to us <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lynch</ENAMEX> says On some occasions when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble Some supporters were stunned this summer when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike He withdrew the remark When he later sided with striking hospital workers some allies cringed a little more concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees Then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> promised he would issue a three year moratorium on construction of garbage incinerator plants That announcement was roundly criticized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Koch</ENAMEX> who has endorsed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent 5 million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s proposal While his public statements have at times been confusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s position papers have more consistently reflected anti development sentiment He favors a form of commercial rent control which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city In the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> residents With an untrained local labor pool many experts believe that policy could drive businesses from the city And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City Many</ENAMEX> economic development officials say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koch</ENAMEX> administration s aggressive approach helped save 5 000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX> jobs from moving across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s economic planks don t seem to bother the business community where he draws significant support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spinola</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real Estate Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> an industry organization says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s economic development program is shortsighted but when it comes down to it he can be reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential The key man seems to be the campaign manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lynch A</ENAMEX> disheveled roly poly son of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> potato farmer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lynch</ENAMEX> is a veteran union organizer who worked on the presidential campaigns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jackson</ENAMEX> But as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> campaign hit tough times this month <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Cuomo</ENAMEX> the politically seasoned son of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> governor is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy Another close ally is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Messinger</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> city councilwoman some of whose programs such as commercial rent control have made their way into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s position papers If she remains influential with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> as some suggest she will his mayoralty may take on a more anti development flavor But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal</ENAMEX> who would head a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> transition team is more mainstream as is real estate executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Gliedman</ENAMEX> another insider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D Robinson III</ENAMEX> investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix Rohatyn</ENAMEX> leveraged buy out specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reginald Lewis</ENAMEX> and attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Flom</ENAMEX> Some business leaders and others also believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background Names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ravitch</ENAMEX> former schools chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Macchiarola</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs Leventhal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gliedman</ENAMEX> Then there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s old time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlem</ENAMEX> colleagues such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S Rep Rangel</ENAMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deputy Mayor Paterson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sutton Having</ENAMEX> attained positions of real influence or wealth these men constitute the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Guard</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> black politics they are less confrontational than the younger more activist black political community that has been based largely in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn Part</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s strength is his ability to win the support of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlem</ENAMEX> factions We know there are potholes for the city out there says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Paterson Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s former law partner If any of us think we re going to sidetrack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> s determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us we are making a sad mistake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adds Ms Messinger</ENAMEX> who is expected to win the borough president s job <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> is vacating You have to remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> is a pragmatist But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider s determination not to upset the political apple cart He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether as mayor he plans on reforming the political fiefdoms that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> s school system I will sit down and talk some of the problems out but take on the political system Uh uh he says with a shake of the head Despite many doubts about his candidacy white New Yorkers who gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> 30 of their votes in the primary aren t expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> The former U S attorney who prosecuted targets ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mafia</ENAMEX> dons to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> executives has succeeded in raising questions about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s ethical standards but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy As a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> has an inherent handicap As a first time candidate he has been slow to learn the nuances of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> politicking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> is finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> in his many years in public life has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to overlook certain failings The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Hoenlein</ENAMEX> a Jewish community leader In the end I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> will be judged for being <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>David</ENAMEX>
