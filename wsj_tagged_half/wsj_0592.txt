<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> s instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual That may be the last thing she needs As the air clears from last week s storm of resignations and reshufflings the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer the untested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> has to come to terms with European economic integration beginning with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> is committed to joining fully someday Finally the government has to convince a rattled financial community and voters it is proceeding coherently toward its goals It sounds like the work of a decade but the deadline is late 1991 when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> is expected to call another national election What s worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Though Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> has pulled through other crises supporters wonder if her steely autocratic ways are the right formula today There s a rising fear that perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s style of management has become a political liability says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Martin</ENAMEX> senior economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UBS Phillips Drew</ENAMEX> The prime minister s insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exchequer Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> confused the financial community Last week the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> quit in exasperation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan Walters</ENAMEX> the adviser announced his resignation within an hour The confusion could be costly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Currency</ENAMEX> traders suspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Major</ENAMEX> won t defend the pound strenuously sent the British currency sharply lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> against the dollar and West German mark Analysts expect further jitters this week A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate currently 15 That could shove a weak economy into recession Economists have been anticipating a slump for months but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s economy is developing rapidly toward no growth says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J Paul Horne</ENAMEX> international economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney Harris Upham Co</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris A</ENAMEX> mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991 economists say while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992 Recovery could be hampered if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s major trading partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> which are enjoying robust economic activity cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991 That would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> little room for maneuver For the Tories to win the next election voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Though Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> doesn t need to call an election until June 1992 she would prefer doing so in late 1991 If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year s time she will be very vulnerable says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Barnes</ENAMEX> a lecturer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London School</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics</ENAMEX> There s an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange rate mechanism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> which links the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> currencies At a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">June EC</ENAMEX> summit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> appeared to ease her opposition to full <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> membership saying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> would join once its inflation rate fell and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> liberalized capital movements Since then the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> assailed the monetary arrangement as half baked in an article being published in an American economics journal That produced little reaction from his boss reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> membership Despite the departure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> the tug of war over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> could continue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Geoffrey Howe</ENAMEX> deputy prime minister and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> ally on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership Of immediate concern is whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> government will continue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> and responding in kind when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> authorities move interest rates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> doesn t like taking orders from foreigners says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Congdon</ENAMEX> economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerrard National Holding PLC</ENAMEX> As Conservatives rally around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> during the crisis many harbor hopes last week s debacle will prompt change We won t have any more of this wayward behavior says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Peter Hordern</ENAMEX> a backbench Tory member of Parliament The party is fed up with sackings of good people It s an unrealistic expectation As long as a decade ago <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> declared she didn t want debate in her cabinet she wanted strong government Over the weekend she said she didn t intend to change her style and denied she is authoritarian Nonsense she told an interviewer yesterday on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London Weekend Television</ENAMEX> I am staying my own sweet reasonable self
