This seems to be the season for revivals in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubs</ENAMEX> championship season ended with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League</ENAMEX> playoffs a revival of the Organic Theater s production of Bleacher Bums a play in nine innings set in the Wrigley Field bleachers continues within spitting distance of the ballpark Revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupes the Goodman and Steppenwolf Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship but both help explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> remains a vital center of this country s regional theater movement The Goodman is offering a modernized version of Moliere s The Misanthrope through Nov 4 The original is a comedy about Alceste a man who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself He is the jealous friend of Philinte and the jealous lover of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> The play is filled with intrigue dishonesty and injustice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty</ENAMEX> five years ago the poet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wilbur</ENAMEX> modernized this 17th century comedy merely by avoiding the zounds sort of thing as he wrote in his introduction Otherwise the scene remained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> s house in 1666 Assuming modern audiences readily understand that Moliere s social indictment covers their world as well as 17th century <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris Mr Wilbur</ENAMEX> concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter The Wilbur translation is remarkable well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity But if you happen to be coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> in the next few weeks don t fail to have a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Falls</ENAMEX> s The Misanthrope at the Goodman If Mr Wilbur s translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th century <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris Mr Falls</ENAMEX> s production is a mirror in which we see ourselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Falls</ENAMEX> the Goodman s artistic director took a recent adaptation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Bartlett</ENAMEX> and significantly adapted it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bartlett</ENAMEX> had slimmed Moliere s cast of characters to six and set them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> media world of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thatcherite Britain Mr Falls</ENAMEX> transfers the setting to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there agents producers actors writers and sycophants It works <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bartlett</ENAMEX> managed to more or less maintain Moliere s Alexandrine verse form 12 syllable lines in rhyming couplets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Falls</ENAMEX> kept the form but Americanized it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bartlett</ENAMEX> s further help With a splendid cast led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Darlow</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alceste Christina Haag</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brown</ENAMEX> as a Philinte who plays the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> game but harbors authentic values and feelings the Goodman production barrels through an all night <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> party with exuberance and wit If this version with its references to Steven Spielberg Spago and thirtysomething attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Bartlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> are justified in abandoning Mr Wilbur A 300 year old play may be easier to revive than one merely 25 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steppenwolf Theatre Company</ENAMEX> back from a critical and box office success in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> with its adaptation of Steinbeck s The Grapes of Wrath opened the new season with Harold Pinter s The Homecoming first produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Royal Shakespeare Company</ENAMEX> in 1965 Back then Mr Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue When The Homecoming was first produced on this side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> actors and directors were reverential Silences were lengthy nobody moved or gestured Nobody smiled onstage and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh This kind of theater was new to us Also it was not a funny time over here what with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> the 68 68 Democratic convention assassinations and riots But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Perry</ENAMEX> s direction the current Steppenwolf production scheduled to play through Nov 19 breaks through the flat and boring ritual that The Homecoming had become Led by a near perfect performance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Wilder</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> the father the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family s rage bitterness fear and isolation Encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wilder</ENAMEX> s sly grins embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act Three of the family members <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> and his two sons Lenny and Joey live off the flesh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> is a retired butcher Lenny a pimp and Joey an aspiring boxer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Max</ENAMEX> s brother has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife Teddy the eldest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> s sons has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an American university Though it s clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> s wife who held sway here until her death now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> The play concerns Teddy s homecoming with his wife of six years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> Curiously <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Arney</ENAMEX> as Teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a Pinter character As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Moira Harris</ENAMEX> a large and beautiful woman who may be our next Colleen Dewhurst begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men In the end Teddy returns alone to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> s chair We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother and then some While Steppenwolf was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> with The Grapes of Wrath Bruce Sagan the president of its board of directors quietly returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> to buy a piece of real estate in the city s rapidly reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North Halsted Street</ENAMEX> restaurant and theater district Within a year he hopes Steppenwolf will move into a new 500 seat theater on that site The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one set production If we wanted to stage Death of a Salesman Mr Sagan says Willie Loman would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling Steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space It s currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13 000 who can be accommodated in its present digs For all the attention that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> theater has received during the past decade not one new building has been devoted to it Mr Sagan a former publisher and real estate developer has put together an 8 million financial package that includes approximately 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater and approximately 1 million in grants from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Endowment</ENAMEX> for the Arts the Macarthur Foundation and a few other deep pockets The rest he is confident can be raised His board members alone have pledged 800 000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations Mr Sagan compares the importance of Steppenwolf with Orson Welles s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury Theater</ENAMEX> in the 30s But Welles s theater company turned out to have a brief one might say a mercurial existence What will Mr Sagan do with his new theater building if the allure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich Dangerous Liaisons Joan Allen</ENAMEX> The Heidi Chronicles and Glenne Headly Lonesome Dove and the company crumbles That s OK Mr Sagan replies Let this building be Steppenwolf s legacy to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> theater Mr Henning is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> based law firm management
