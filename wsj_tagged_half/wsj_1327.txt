At age eight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine Baker</ENAMEX> was sent by her mother to a white woman s house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep a place in the basement with the coal At age 19 she was a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> sensation transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade It is the stuff of dreams but also of traumas Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters And for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Baker</ENAMEX> the ride was far from over Her bare breasts her dancing her voice her beauty and perhaps most famously her derriere were prominent attractions but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible Bricktop another American black woman who found a measure of fame in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> said I don t think I ve ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life or whose life was more complicated than Josephine s Men were a constant complication <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had lots of them But she didn t trust them and didn t reward trust As she saw one key love affair the problem wasn t her infidelity it was his jealousy Her appetite for children also was large She adopted 12 of assorted races naming them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainbow Tribe</ENAMEX> and driving her husband first to despair and then to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> She made money but spent more Friends pitched in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finally Prince Rainier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Princess Grace</ENAMEX> saved her with the offer of a house in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monaco</ENAMEX> Another lifelong complication as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Rose</ENAMEX> makes clear in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jazz Cleopatra Josephine Baker</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Her Time Doubleday</ENAMEX> 321 pages 22 50 was racism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had the good luck to arrive in 1925 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> where blacks had become exotic African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized but for the most part <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> was a friendly island in a racist world <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had bitter experience of bigotry from her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St Louis</ENAMEX> childhood and her days in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> theater where she was judged too dark for an all black chorus line performing of course for all white audiences <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> loved her at first sight She just wiggled her fanny and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">French</ENAMEX> fell in love with her sniffed the literary world s Maria Jolas not entirely inaccurately One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end Ms Rose writes Ms Rose who teaches literature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesleyan University</ENAMEX> quickly proceeds to overemphasize claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> s dancing had uncovered a new region for desire and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous Jazz Cleopatra contains other more important false notes that undermine what is for the most part a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works It is easy to see why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women attracts Ms Rose the author of Parallel Lives a wonderful study of Victorian marriage Still even the title raises questions about the author s vision of her subject <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> s art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term To find parallels other than sexual appeal with Cleopatra requires an equal stretch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> was 68 years old when she died in <ENAMEX

Casablanca that could have made it into Casablanca During World War II her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted a decision made by only about 2 of French citizens She was devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> de Gaulle s cause accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one

black arm bands and when she sang J ai J ai deux amours they wept Ms Rose is best on the early years and World War II In her introduction Ms Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> but as Jazz Cleopatra goes on it seems more rushed as though the author were growing less interested It doesn t help that sometimes Ms Rose s language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want One chapter opens World War II was not one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> s glorious moments Elsewhere in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer Ms Rose writes She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman One devoted fan who fell under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> s spell in 1963 and began collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> memorabilia was
