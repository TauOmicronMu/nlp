<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soichiro Honda</ENAMEX> s picture now hangs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry Ford</ENAMEX> s in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S Automotive Hall</ENAMEX> of Fame and the game show Jeopardy is soon to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> owned But no matter how much <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> gets under our skin we ll still have mom and apple pie On second thought make that just mom A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U S roads By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree according to a recent survey of six apple industry sages by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington State University</ENAMEX> horticulturist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Norton</ENAMEX> Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> s apple heap It certainly won t get there on looks Compared to the Red Delicious the exemplar of apple pulchritude the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy generally smaller less perfectly shaped greenish with tinges of red To hear most U S growers tell it we d still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve But how sweet it is It has more sugar than any apple we ve ever tested says Duane Greene a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> pomologist or apple scholar It has a long shelf life and doesn t fool the public says Grady Auvil an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orondo Wash</ENAMEX> grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them It doesn t look nice on the outside while getting mealy inside Mr Auvil razor sharp at 83 has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years He is known as the father of the U S grown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Granny Smith</ENAMEX> a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on It did shaking the apple establishment to its roots Now even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed The Fuji is going to be No 1 to replace the Red Delicious he says The Delicious hegemony won t end anytime soon New apple trees grow slowly and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom Its roots are patriotic with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru Iowa</ENAMEX> to be exact For more than 50 years it has been the apple of our eye A good Delicious can indeed be delicious More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Golden</ENAMEX> variety <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> s No 2 apple But the apple industry is ripe for change Red Delicious has been overplanted and its prices have dropped below the cost of production says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington State</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Norton</ENAMEX> The scare over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alar</ENAMEX> a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic made consumers shy away from the Delicious though they were less affected than the Mcintosh The glut and consequent lower prices combined with cancer fears was a very serious blow to growers A lot of growers won t be around in a few years says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Norton</ENAMEX> although they have stopped using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alar</ENAMEX> One may be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Broderick</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sterling Mass</ENAMEX> grower This is beautiful stuff he says looking ruefully at big boxes of just picked Red Delicious next to his barn But I m going to lose 50 000 to 60 000 on it I m going to have to get another job this year just to eat Besides rotten prices he has been hit recently by hail a bark nibbling horde of mice fungi and bugs Some 500 insects and 150 diseases wiggle chew and romp through growers nightmares including maggots mites mildew thrips black rot and the flat headed borer Even if a grower beats them back his 2 000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors orchards instead of pollinating his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Broderick</ENAMEX> says Though growers can t always keep the worm from the apple they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying into the recently imported Gala a sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> native the Esopus Spitzenburg reportedly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> s favorite apple disease resistant kinds like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liberty</ENAMEX> I ve ripped out a lot of Delicious and grafted the trees with many different shoots says Steve Wood a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Lebanon N H</ENAMEX> grower tramping through his 100 acre <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poverty Lane Orchard</ENAMEX> on a crisp autumn day recently I ve got 70 kinds of apples Here s a Waltana he exclaims picking one off a tree He bites it scowls and throws it down It s a real dog Supermarkets are getting into the variety act too They still buy apples mainly for big red good looks that s why so many taste like woodchucks punching bags But freshness counts more than it once did and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional but tastier and often pricier apples Rather than sell 39 cents a pound Delicious maybe we can sell 79 cents a pound Fujis says Chuck Tryon perishables director for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Valu Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> supermarket chain and food distributor The Fuji is a product of meticulous Japanese pomological engineering which fostered it 50 years ago at a government research orchard Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis to hone its color taste and shelf life Now the best of them age as gracefully as Grannies the industry s gold standard for storability In the cornucopia of go go apples the Fuji s track record stands out During the past 15 years it has gone from almost zilch to some 50 of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s market The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lane</ENAMEX> a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summerland British Columbia</ENAMEX> and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX> estimates that this year Americans will eat about 40 more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U S sold mainly in fruit boutiques But in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Ito</ENAMEX> a Fuji apple grower There s a Fuji apple cult Once somebody eats one they get hooked Mr Auvil the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> grower says that he could sell Fujis to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> buyers at 40 a box if he had them <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> already is a big importer of Fujis from other places he adds But his first crop won t be picked till next year I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years he adds <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Red Delicious</ENAMEX> by the way are wholesaling for less than 10 a box these days Mr Auvil sees Fujis in part as striking a blow against the perversion of U S apples by supermarkets When the chain stores took over there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer A guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you re going to eat After all until the 1950s even the Red Delicious was a firm delectable morsel Then as growers bred them more for looks and to satisfy supermarket chains demands of long term storage the Red went into decline Now those red applelike things stores sell in summer are fruitbowl lovely but usually not good eating They do deserve respect however they are almost a year old probably equal to about 106 in human years The Fuji to be sure has blemishes too It ripens later than most apples and growing it in U S areas with chilly autumns may be tricky Moreover the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delicious Mr Broderick</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> grower says the big boss at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they weren t waxed and brushed for extra shine And he hadn t used hormones which many growers employ to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal Still Mr Auvil points out Grannies became popular without big red looks so why not Fujis He sees a shift in American values at least regarding apples toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz Taste has finally come to the fore he says Or for that matter the core
