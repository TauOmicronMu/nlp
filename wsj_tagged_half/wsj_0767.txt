The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> Communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone Telegraph Co</ENAMEX> to continue offering discount phone services for large business customers and said it would soon re examine its regulation of the long distance market The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> moves were good news for AT T which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Sikes</ENAMEX> the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> chairman championed deregulation of AT T at his last job as head of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> telecommunications agency But it has been an open question whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sikes</ENAMEX> an extraordinarily cautious man would continue pushing deregulation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure It means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> is serious about the deregulation of long distance said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Grubman</ENAMEX> a telecommunications analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc</ENAMEX> who attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> meeting All the commissioners were in amazing agreement to re examine regulation for only having been together for a few months The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> took three specific actions regarding AT T By a 4 0 vote it allowed AT T to continue offering special discount packages to big customers called Tariff 12 rejecting appeals by AT T competitors that the discounts were illegal Then by a separate 4 0 vote it chose the narrowest possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan called Tariff 15 that AT T offered to Holiday Corp AT T gave a 5 to 10 discount to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis Tenn</ENAMEX> company that oversees Holiday Inns in response to a similar discount offered to Holiday Corp by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> Communications Corp The agency said that because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> s offer had expired AT T couldn t continue to offer its discount plan But the agency specifically didn t rule whether AT T had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users Indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Nacchio AT T</ENAMEX> s vice president for business communications services said AT T offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resort Condominium International</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> to meet another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> bid The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> didn t say I couldn t do it again he said Apart from those two actions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sikes</ENAMEX> and the three other commissioners said they expect to re examine how AT T is regulated since competition has increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Firestone</ENAMEX> chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> s common carrier bureau said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year AT T applauded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> s actions The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long distance business and the rules governing it the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> telecommunications firm said in a statement But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> was displeased with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> decision concerning Tariff 12 arguing that AT T can not be allowed to flaunt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> rules <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> s US Sprint unit said it was obviously disappointed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> decision on Tariff 12 US Sprint said was it will petition the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> decision in federal court We believe that the court will find it unlawful said a US Sprint spokesman Separately AT T filed a countersuit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly false and deceptive advertising The AT T action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight Earlier this month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> sued AT T in federal district court claiming that AT T s ads are false AT T assembled three of its top executives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> all visibly angry to try to refute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> s charges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT T said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Grubman</ENAMEX> who said he expected AT T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Amparano Lopez</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> also contributed to this article
