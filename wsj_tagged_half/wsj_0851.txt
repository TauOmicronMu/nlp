The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Post</ENAMEX> plans to close down its Sunday edition after launching it just eight months ago with much fanfare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Kalikow</ENAMEX> owner and publisher of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> announced that he would discontinue the edition which he initially started in the hopes of luring upscale readers and retail advertisers that shunned the more sensational tabloid in favor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily News Industry</ENAMEX> observers and analysts still are unsure whether folding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Post</ENAMEX> will guarantee that the paper will survive When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> sold the paper to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kalikow</ENAMEX> it was posting losses of 10 million a year by conservative estimates In its first 10 weeks the Sunday edition alone was estimated to have recorded a deficit of as much as 7 million <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kalikow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Editor Jerry Nachman</ENAMEX> assembled employees in the paper s newsroom in lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> yesterday afternoon to break the news which had been rumored in recent weeks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> executives had denied earlier reports that the Sunday edition was closing down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kalikow</ENAMEX> said the death of the Sunday paper is no indication that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> itself is in danger of closing down as some industry observers have speculated By closing down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Post</ENAMEX> he said in a statement the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> foresees a profitable year in 1990 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> s last Sunday edition will be Nov 26 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kalikow</ENAMEX> blamed the demise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Post</ENAMEX> on the soft ad market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> area and on low circulation The economics just aren t there he said While there has been a wave of new Sunday newspapers launched in small to medium sized cities in the last decade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> was by far the largest newspaper to launch a Sunday edition in years While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> executives had expected circulation would reach 500 000 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valerie Salembier</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> said the Sunday circulation has reached only about 250 000 In any other city 250 000 would be considered great but it just wasn t enough in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Salembier Ms Salembier</ENAMEX> said about 30 people in circulation ad sales and other business departments would lose their jobs What we don t know about is the number of layoffs on the editorial side she said The editorial side is more complicated she added saying that editorial layoffs will be announced later The paper has been particularly hurt by declines in the level of real estate and retail advertising and by the fact that the Sunday paper could not attract any coupons from national companies In late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> the paper announced its was canceling its weekly real estate section The section had shrunk from more than 20 pages to six pages recently as a result of declines in advertising Months earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kalikow</ENAMEX> had already begun to scale back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday Post</ENAMEX> In May the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX> said it would scratch all supplements in the Sunday edition including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">USA Weekend</ENAMEX> magazine and cut the 1 price to 40 cents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Salembier</ENAMEX> said closing the Sunday paper was a big disappointment but the right move We were losing a lot of money While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Kalikow</ENAMEX> has deep pockets it makes sense to put our resources into our Monday through Saturday product she said
