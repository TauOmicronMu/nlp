Outside the white walled headquarters of the socalled Society of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> all seems normal in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> s abnormal society A pickup truck driven by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back Over at Conradies the general store a black stock boy scurries to help an elderly white woman with her packages Down the street a car pulls into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> station and is surrounded by black attendants But inside the white walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> office just about the largest building in town save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> s neat racial order is awry A dozen white office workers fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> women serve tea and coffee and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows There isn t a black worker in sight Not in the kitchen or the storeroom or the book shop If we want to have our own nation then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves says Hendrik Verwoerd Jr son of the former prime minister and the leader of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> founded in 1980 They do indeed want their own nation The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Johannesburg</ENAMEX> opening its public facilities to all races blacks storming the all white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African National Congress</ENAMEX> But here in Morgenzon a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers are holding the pillars steady The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers who take their name from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> a hero of the Dutch descended Afrikaners believe that the solution to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> s racial problems isn t the abolition of apartheid it s the perfection of apartheid complete and total separation of the races Here then is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers have come to make apartheid s last stand Their idea is to create a city first and then an entire nation without blacks This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> And the fact that there are only 3 000 card carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers may put them on the loony fringe But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland an all white reserve to be carved out of present day <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> is a mainstream desire of the right wing which embraces about one third of the country s five million whites Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> are just putting this preaching into practice Thus farmer Johan Fischer his T shirt and jeans covered in grease crawls around under his planter tightening bolts and fixing dents On almost every other farm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> black workers do the repairs But not here Mr Fischer plows his own fields sows his own corn and sunflowers and feeds his own sheep Over at the fiberglass factory four white workers assemble water tanks on their own and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road On Main Street Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family Down by the stream a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> puts the finishing touches on a golf course If whites want to play there by themselves says consulting engineer Willem van Heerden whites should also build it by themselves If we want to survive as a people he says we have to change our way of life The Afrikaner must end his reliance on others In their quest to perfect apartheid the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> tries mightily to deny The master can t become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever If apartheid means you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that go with it but you also want to exclude the blacks from social and political integration then these are two contradictions that can t go on forever says Mr Verwoerd He is sitting in his living room beneath a huge portrait of his late father Hendrik F Verwoerd apartheid s architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966 Somewhere the son sighs things went terribly wrong with apartheid today whites even rely on blacks to police their separation People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it But my father meant it to mean real separation says the son The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> speak sincerely We agree with world opinion that the status quo in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> is morally wrong says Pieter Bruwer the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> chief scribe and pamphleteer We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom According to Mr Verwoerd the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal even before the blacks Then when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908 the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town blacks could work there but they had to leave at night Today Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks and many houses and storefronts are empty There are few factories and no mines It was an ideal place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers to start their new nation unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa So</ENAMEX> far about 150 Orange Workers have moved here spending nearly 1 million buying up property over the past three years Still complete and total segregation remains elusive Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2 000 blacks who are employed throughout the area Despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers intention to put them all out of work they are in no hurry to leave A young man called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> that s when he was born who works at the railroad station just up the street from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Workers</ENAMEX> office points at the whitewalled building and says matter of factly We re not allowed in there that s all I know The 650 or so local whites who aren t <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers are more troubled Try as they might they just can t conceive of life without black workers Impossible impossible say the Conradies an elderly couple who have run the general store for decades We can t do without their help says Mrs Conradie Oh no We need them and I thank <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> for them Over at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> station owner Rudi van Dyk who doubles as Morgenzon s mayor worries that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation What they want us to do just isn t practical he says noting that he employs 16 blacks I couldn t afford to hire 16 whites The only Afrikaners who would be willing to work for this salary wouldn t know how to handle money Back at the Verwoerd house Hendrik Sr peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics Morgenzon will boom We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation says Mr Verwoerd By populating a place now we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account Curiously he compares the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX> Workers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> which his father outlawed in 1960 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANC</ENAMEX> won t be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations says Mr Verwoerd Likewise no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners He apologizes for sounding pushy Look he says If the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> wants to have an integrated melting pot that s their choice We ll leave them alone We just want to have our own cup of tea And they will even serve it themselves
