The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> passed legislation designed to make it easier for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to block airline leveraged buy outs The final vote came after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry but the 300 113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto The broader question is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> stands on the issue While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> has approved legislation similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> bill on airline leveraged buy outs the measure hasn t yet come to the full floor Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier s ability to compete <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep John Paul Hammerschmidt R Ark</ENAMEX> said The bill as it was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Public Works</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Committee</ENAMEX> would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 or more of the stock in an airline The department would be required to block the buy out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired its ability to compete would be sharply diminished it would be put into foreign control or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline related assets unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> approved an amendment offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Peter Defazio D Ore</ENAMEX> that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier s employees or their wages or benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rep James Traficant D Ohio</ENAMEX> said the amendment which passed 271 147 would let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Hammerschmidt</ENAMEX> said that the provision which he dubbed a special interest amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial On Tuesday the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> approved a labor backed amendment that would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code The provision called the two time losers amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Air Corp Chairman Frank Lorenzo</ENAMEX> from attempting to take over another airline
