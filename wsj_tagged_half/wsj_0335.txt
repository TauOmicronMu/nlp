<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> and state thrift examiners said they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln Savings Loan Association</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> regulator described an attempted whitewash by deputies of chief federal regulator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Wall</ENAMEX> In a riveting day of hearings before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> the examiners described finding shredded documents a mysterious Panamanian subsidiary millions of dollars funneled into a Swiss bank and a complacent attitude by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> s deputies one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">A California</ENAMEX> official also said he sent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Investigation</ENAMEX> a packet of documents relating to a previously reported 400 000 contribution from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s parent solicited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Alan Cranston D Calif Federal</ENAMEX> examiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Barabolak</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s operations amounted to pyramiding debt to provide a luxurious life style for its owners Another federal examiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Meek</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s principal owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating Jr</ENAMEX> and his family drew off at least 34 million from the thrift in salaries bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the 3 1 2 years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s collapse may cost taxpayers as much as 2 5 billion according to estimates making it the most expensive thrift failure in history I think there s overwhelming evidence to indicate probable criminal activity said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Meek</ENAMEX> who participated last year in an examination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irvine Calif</ENAMEX> thrift He said the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating</ENAMEX> and others although he didn t allege any specific violation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Newsom</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> state official who last year examined <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental Corp</ENAMEX> said he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed It sure smells like it he said He said 30 of the loans he sampled were dead meat on the day they were made The state examiner also said supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write downs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious Later on my concerns about a whitewash became even more serious he said He called the sour loans appalling and added You opened the file up and it just jumped at you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bickwit</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s parent corporation said in an interview We deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers Those who testified yesterday have consistently maintained that anyone who didn t agree with them is part of a coverup a whitewash or the subject of excessive influence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bickwit</ENAMEX> said We simply don t agree with that or the findings of their investigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> s deputies complained that they hadn t been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> s hearings which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez D Texas</ENAMEX> has used as a forum to flay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> s handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job A couple of things <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Newsom</ENAMEX> said were at least misleading said Kevin O Connell one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> regulators responsible for the handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> In an interview he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss and forced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> to make an 18 million downward adjustment on another Our response to the whitewash would simply be look what happened another <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvin Smuzynski</ENAMEX> said in an interview <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> officials seized the association in April a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy law proceedings The government later brought a 1 1 billion fraud suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating</ENAMEX> and others <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Gonzalez</ENAMEX> has complained that regulators waited far too long however ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> into receivership two years before it failed He took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Gonzalez</ENAMEX> said State thrift examiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Stelzer</ENAMEX> said he found the chief federal examiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Scott</ENAMEX> to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions Frankly it was like he worked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> public relations department <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stelzer</ENAMEX> testified And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Riley</ENAMEX> a federal examiner who worked under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Scott</ENAMEX> said he found his chief oddly upbeat about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> Asked to comment a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Scott</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Scott</ENAMEX> has spoken to his attorney who has advised him not to talk to anybody <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Meek</ENAMEX> said that a day or two before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s parent entered bankruptcy proceedings he and other examiners saw a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the Document Destruction Center We observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bickwit</ENAMEX> said the paper had been donated to a charitable organization that sells it for recycling They shredded it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and depositors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Meek</ENAMEX> said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> including 22 million paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> an 18 million interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi European Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> a 17 5 million investment in a Bahamas trading company and a recently discovered holding in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> based company <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southbrook Holdings Mr Bickwit</ENAMEX> said I can see why an S NN L examiner would regard these as unusual activities but said the overseas investments essentially broke even for the S <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>L</ENAMEX>
