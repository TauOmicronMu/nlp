High definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow so it is a natural multibillion dollar market Although major U S manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> not everyone here is ready to give up A handful of small U S companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin high quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s With only small help from the government these start up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photonics Technology Inc</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northwood Ohio</ENAMEX> aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick Planar Systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beaverton Ore</ENAMEX> the largest of these firms with 20 million in annual revenue has similar plans It already has had success in electroluminescence another promising technology adaptable for high definition television Two other firms Ovonic Imaging Systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Troy Mich</ENAMEX> and Magnascreen Corp of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> are developing a variation of the flat panel screens called active matrix liquid crystal displays The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode ray tube which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set Replacing the cathode ray tube with a large thin screen is the key to the creation of a high definition television or HDTV which is expected to become a 30 billion business world wide within a decade Large U S companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business such as signal processing and broadcast equipment But except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zenith Electronics Corp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business</ENAMEX> Machines Corp which is collaborating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> on computer displays they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co</ENAMEX> recently sold off its interests in liquid crystal displays to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson CSF</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> We found the market not developing as we thought it would a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> spokesman says The small U S firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents and because the prize is still there to be seized No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels at commercial costs says Zvi Yaniv the president of Ovonic Imaging He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be isn t doing much for now The only material support it is extending to the struggling U S industry is 30 million in awards from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Advanced Research</ENAMEX> Projects Agency The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and other prospective competitors are spending The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over 1 billion Unless it gets more help the U S industry won t have a chance says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Friedman Photonics</ENAMEX> s executive vice president Thus far almost all of the basic technology relating to high definition television has come from U S laboratories But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Brody Magnascreen s</ENAMEX> president says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use just as they did with earlier U S innovations in color television and video recording In the 1970s Mr Brody helped develop the first display panels based on active matrix liquid crystals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp</ENAMEX> s research labs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image In 1979 however <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television Mr Brody left the company to find other backers He has a claim to the right to commercialize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> patents but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers Most American investors have just given up Mr Brody says They aren t prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter Many critics question the industry s need for federal support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> justifies its help on national security grounds We don t see a domestic source for some of our HDTV requirements and that s a source of concern says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kelly</ENAMEX> director of DARPA s defense manufacturing office So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds HDTV already has some military applications such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> wants smaller versions for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abrams</ENAMEX> battle tanks The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries It isn t just yuppie television argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Clifford</ENAMEX> director of the department s office of microelectronics and instrumentation The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid such as antitrust relief for research consortia the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial They also want U S trade policy to reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> department s concern over their future They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Hitachi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> to exempt portable color Tvs with liquid crystal displays from anti dumping duties that the U S imposes on the larger Japanese color Tvs And they want the U S to help them sell overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Planar President James Hurd</ENAMEX> says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 to sell his display panels in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> while panels from those countries enter the U S duty free This isn t a technology issue but an attitude issue he says We just haven t learned what it takes to compete
