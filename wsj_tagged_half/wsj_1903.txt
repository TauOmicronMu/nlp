Dale Lang who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms and Sassy is candid about the challenge he is taking on Mr Lang admits that Ms is in dire straits and that Sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive But the 57 year old publisher has moved quickly and boldly to deal with the magazines problems Last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> he told the staff of Ms that the magazine in January would begin publishing without advertising Mr Lang will do away with expensive circulation drives not to mention sales staff and attempt to publish the 17 year old magazine supported by circulation revenue alone Any fool can publish a money losing magazine I want to publish one that succeeds said Mr Lang For Ms it s time to publish for the reader not the advertiser As for Sassy which competes directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp</ENAMEX> s Seventeen magazine Mr Lang says that in the next two years he will spend 6 million promoting and improving the magazine Though Sassy has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988 it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen age problems Mr Lang said the former Australian owners of Sassy were blind sided by the Moral Majority Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out He said Sassy will keep its irreverent tone but added We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine Sassy already has recovered circulation has quickly passed the 500 000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300 What s more Mr Lang says he has what all publishers wish for a bona fide niche Seventeen is written more for mothers not their daughters said Mr Lang But Sassy has a different spirit It gets more mail in a month than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s got in a year and it s not from mothers I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago Mr Lang took on Ms and Sassy with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda Publications Inc</ENAMEX> by his newly formed Lang Communications Lang owns 70 of Matilda while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> owns the rest through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp Venture Capital Partners</ENAMEX> Two weeks ago <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and Mr Lang pumped 800 000 into Matilda just to keep the doors open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry</ENAMEX> observers have congratulated Mr Lang on what some call his courageous handling of Ms but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews Besides Ms and Sassy closely held Lang Communications includes Success a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses and Working Woman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> two monthly magazines Working Woman with circulation near one million and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> with 625 000 circulation are legitimate magazine success stories The magazine Success however was for years lackluster and unfocused Only recently has it been attractively redesigned and its editorial product improved Success is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival Venture another magazine for growing companies Working Woman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> have operated as part of Working <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woman Mccall</ENAMEX> s Group a less than successful joint venture between Mr Lang and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc</ENAMEX> The joint venture is being undone with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s magazine being sold last summer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Times Co s Magazine Group</ENAMEX> for about 80 million and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> agreeing to sell back its 50 interest in Working Woman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother</ENAMEX> to Mr Lang Executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc Magazine Co</ENAMEX> a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> have said the joint venture with Mr Lang wasn t a good one The venture formed in 1986 was supposed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s low cost safe entry into women s magazines Mr Lang surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine publishers In addition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s put in a less than stellar performance Until a recent comeback it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality and in the end one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executive who asked not to be identified said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankly Mccall</ENAMEX> s and the joint venture were an embarrassment Mr Lang feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s priorities changed Their management changed right after the venture was formed and I don t think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women s service magazines Today Mr Lang believes his magazines will offer what many women s magazines don t We write straight for women on their level he said We don t have passive readers Mr Lang points out that even Success in part fits the company s image since about 30 of its readership is female Mr Lang has named Carol Taber 43 as group publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> based Lang Communications She will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Woman Working Mother</ENAMEX> and Success magazines and retain her post as publisher of Working Woman The sale price of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX> s twice what Mr Lang originally paid for it will finance Lang Communications buy back of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> s 50 interest in Working Woman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Working Mother Mr Lang</ENAMEX> says he isn t scouting new acquisitions at least for now We would have to go outside to banks to get the money and I am not ready to do that he said Besides we have enough on our plate There is plenty of work to be done on what we have
