This is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event The irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year s presidential campaign has come of age in an off off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country But in the three leading political contests of 1989 the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility raising fears that this kind of mudslinging empty of significant issues is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content Now says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Napolitan</ENAMEX> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes tawdry art form in 1988 has reached an entirely new stage To get people s attention these days says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Bailey</ENAMEX> a political consultant your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means confrontational And unlike a few years ago you don t even have to worry whether the ad is truthful In 1989 as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves Take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday s elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia New York City</ENAMEX> The screen fills with a small tight facial shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> Democratic candidate for mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City David Dinkins</ENAMEX> failed to file his income taxes for four straight years says a disembodied male voice And then this television commercial paid for by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Republican Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> s campaign and produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Ailes</ENAMEX> the master of negative TV ads really gets down to business <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Dinkins</ENAMEX> says the kicker Why does he always wait until he s caught Nasty innuendoes says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Siegal Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s issues director designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply doesn t exist Stung by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> ads <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s TV consultants <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Shrum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Doak</ENAMEX> finally unleashed a negative ad of their own The screen shows two distorted unrecognizable photos presumably of two politicians Compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer One says he s for banning cop killer bullets The other has opposed a ban on cop killer bullets One claims he s pro choice The other has opposed a woman s right to choose Funny thing says the kicker both these candidates are named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani Who</ENAMEX> s telling the truth Everybody and nobody It s a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it The city s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campaign Finance Board</ENAMEX> has refused to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> 95 142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors And says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> he didn t know the man his campaign paid for a get out the vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping But say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> s managers he did have an office and his organization did have members <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giuliani</ENAMEX> s campaign chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Powers</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinkins</ENAMEX> ad is deceptive The other side he argues knows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> has always been pro choice even though he has personal reservations They know he is generally opposed to cop killer bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virginia Democratic Lt Gov Douglas Wilder</ENAMEX> opened his gubernatorial battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Republican Marshall Coleman</ENAMEX> with an abortion commercial produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Greer</ENAMEX> that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force Against a shot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monticello</ENAMEX> superimposed on an American flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that Virginians have nurtured for generations Then just as an image of the statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> dissolves from the screen the announcer continues On the issue of abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Coleman</ENAMEX> wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians That commercial which said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Coleman</ENAMEX> wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Coleman</ENAMEX> denies changed the dynamics of the campaign transforming it at least in part into a referendum on abortion The ad prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Coleman</ENAMEX> the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Goodman</ENAMEX> and designed to shake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wilder</ENAMEX> s support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> counterattack featured a close up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal A voice says C mon now don t you have boyfriends Then an announcer interjects It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Wilder</ENAMEX> who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists So the next time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wilder</ENAMEX> talks about the rights of women ask him about this law he
