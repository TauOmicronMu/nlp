When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Records last month told producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was about to make a 3 4 billion bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> Pictures and needed someone to run the studio <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> jumped at the chance Within two days he was on his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to meet with top brass at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> And before the week was out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> had offered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and his partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business Not only that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also agreed to give them a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> s future profits and buy their company <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters Entertainment Co</ENAMEX> for 200 million almost 40 more than the market value of the company There was just one sticking point The two had a prior commitment Just seven months earlier they had signed a five year exclusive contract to make movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros</ENAMEX> for which they had just produced the smash hit Batman But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> figured that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> Communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Ross</ENAMEX> would empathize and let the producers go knowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer was the culmination of a life s work He figured wrong Last week following fruitless settlement talks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> now merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc</ENAMEX> filed a 1 billion breach of contract suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Superior Court</ENAMEX> against both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters Sony</ENAMEX> promptly countersued charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U S movie business The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides As one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> executive puts it It s World War III That two successful producers who aren t all that well known outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business And they are a very odd team in any case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> was raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> and educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> is a high school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand s hairdresser Yet they are far and away the most prolific producers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> And despite their share of duds they make movies that make money That is a skill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> badly needs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is loath to lose Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> had a good summer with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghostbusters II</ENAMEX> and When Harry Met Sally rivals such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Paramount Pictures Walt Disney Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> have been thrashing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> at the box office After five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> sorely needs a stable savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> aren t universally loved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> but they are well connected Their stock in trade as executive producers is sniffing out hot properties locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a Flashdance or buy rights to a best seller such as The Color Purple It falls to others to do the writing directing and producing With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM UA</ENAMEX> s Rainman for instance <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> had virtually nothing to do with day to day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success Sometimes as with Batman the pair really do make the film In that case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> acquired the rights in 1979 nursed the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production They re the best production talent around says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian De Palma</ENAMEX> beholden to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> for hiring him to direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> movie of Tom Wolfe s novel Bonfire of the Vanities On that film which is to start shooting in a few months they ve been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script And when you re making a movie this big you need all the help you can get Mr De Palma adds I wish they were around 24 hours a day And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> s lack of involvement in Caddyshack II for casting and production problems and the film s ultimate dismal failure We ve had a few bombs admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> But by and large this company has only been profitable He says his company s prowess at packaging and marketing is why we ll be good at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> We practically ran our own studio <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Longtime Hollywood</ENAMEX> associates describe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a flair for deal making and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> is a major piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> manpower who has really earned his success says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bookman</ENAMEX> an agent at Creative Artists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agency Mark Johnson</ENAMEX> the producer of Rainman chimes in He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority It s no accident that they ve been able to develop such successful material <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> on the other hand has fewer fans in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot tempered bully He gets better reviews as a creative whiz an enthusiast an idea man He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did Barbra Streisand made him famous He cut her hair He lived with her He came to produce her records and her movies <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">A Star Is Born</ENAMEX> and The Main Event Thrice married but now single <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> got plenty of ink last summer for an on set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batman Mr Guber</ENAMEX> by contrast has been married to one woman for more than 20 years But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences they make the perfect good cop bad cop team <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> associates say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> is the bright sympathetic guy when you re doing a deal says one agent If there s a problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> disappears and all of a sudden Jon shows up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> rub many people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> the wrong way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Producers Don Simpson</ENAMEX> and Jerry Bruckheimer who shepherded Flashdance through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie bristle when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> take credit for the film <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Says Mr Simpson</ENAMEX> The script was unreadable We reinvented it We are the producers of that movie They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers When Roger Birnbaum an executive who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Artists studio they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop including Rainman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batman Mr Peters</ENAMEX> acknowledges that and says it s not unlike the situation he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> are in with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> I was upset with Roger I fumpered and schmumpered says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> But he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went Still Mr Birnbaum says his relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> was one of the most successful I ve had in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> The two have a wonderful chemistry Jon is very impulsive and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> is very compulsive adds Mr Birnbaum who is now head of production at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp</ENAMEX> s 20th <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Century Fox Film Co Jon Peters</ENAMEX> will come barreling into a room say he s got a great idea and be gone <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific Mr Birnbaum recalls that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey which became Gorillas in the Mist He says Within a few weeks we made deals with the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rwanda</ENAMEX> and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> even made some deals with the gorillas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co produce the film with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> More recently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX> for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> rain forest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> assiduously courted the man s widow for months showing her a tape of Gorillas in the Mist to impress her with the quality of their work Money helped too Ultimately they paid more than 1 million for the rights The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband s followers Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation but it isn t earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest It s hardly astonishing given the men s track record that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> wants <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> But it is puzzling to some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> executives that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> rushed to hire them without clearing up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> situation first Some note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and letting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> stay on to fulfill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> contract But though people in town may ask why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> needs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> it s good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says Steven Tisch a producer who once worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> This business isn t about personalities at the end of the day its about whether the ink is red or black In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> and Jon the ink has been very very black <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> got his start in the movie business at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> two decades ago Recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York University</ENAMEX> s MBA program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as The Way We Were Taxi Driver Tommy and Shampoo In 1976 he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks later called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram</ENAMEX> Pictures where they produced such hits as as The Deep and Midnight Express In 1980 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> got together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of Mr Bogart While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> produced a number of hits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and others their record wasn t always so impressive Among their clinkers were The Legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billie Jean Visionquest Clue</ENAMEX> and Clan of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cave Bear</ENAMEX> And the failures make it possible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates The studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Mr Guber</ENAMEX> replies that this is a Goliath this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> maintain that executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> never felt threatened until they linked up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> From the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> On a number of occasions he adds he tried to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> outright They always listened but they never acted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> says In 1987 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> contributed their company s assets in exchange for a 28 stake in Barris Entertainment a small fry TV production company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giant Industries Inc Chairman Burt Sugarman</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> a year later <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreed to release the producers from their old contract when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Guber Peters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> made a 100 million offer to buy 25 of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MGM UA Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> planned to run the nearly dormant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> studio and the two even tried to interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros President Terry Semel</ENAMEX> in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> plan collapsed just two weeks later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> say they got a look at the books and balked at the price Their relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sugarman</ENAMEX> soured shortly thereafter Last May he sold his 24 stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters Entertainment Co</ENAMEX> Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> had agreed to extend their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreement with the new five year exclusive contract The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom But it paled by comparison to what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about 50 million in deferred compensation up to 10 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> s future cash flow 8 of the future appreciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> s market value and annual salaries of 2 7 million for each The producers 28 share of publicly held <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> would net them an additional 50 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Sony</ENAMEX> is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only 42 million last year And earnings have been erratic In the the latest quarter thanks in part to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batman Guber Peters</ENAMEX> earned 5 8 million or 50 cents a share compared to a loss of 6 8 million or 62 cents a share in last year s quarter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> stock which traded as low as 6 a share last year closed yesterday at 16 625 The two sides now are accusing each other of lying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> claim they have an oral agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise But in affidavits filed yesterday in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> court <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Ross Warner Bros Chairman Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Semel</ENAMEX> deny that such an oral agreement was ever made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> in its court filings calls it a piece of fiction created for this litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Daly</ENAMEX> in his affidavit acknowledges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreed to release the producers last year to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> but says that situation was altogether different For one thing according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Daly</ENAMEX> the producers requested a release in advance Moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> pictures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> wasn t as strong as it is now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> itself was in negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> over certain movie and other rights and it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> s interest to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MGM UA Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> by permitting them to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> executives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Daly</ENAMEX> said in his affidavit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> obviously doesn t think that it is in its own interests to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> go off to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> At the very least <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ross</ENAMEX> clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> During settlement talks for example <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> demanded such things as cable TV rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> movies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> s interest in the studio it jointly owns with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> according to executives involved in the talks In any settlement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> have locked up for the next few years notably sequels to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batman Mr Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Peters</ENAMEX> refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer before taking it up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> And they say there are plenty of precedents in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> for letting people out of contracts The last time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> was looking for a studio chief they note <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> released producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Puttnam</ENAMEX> from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> In his affidavit filed yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ross</ENAMEX> indicated he isn t buying any such argument If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> succeeds here no written contract in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> will be worth the paper it s written on
