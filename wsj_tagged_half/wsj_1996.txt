In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> soon after Wang Laboratories <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> reported a staggering 424 3 million loss and replaced its president two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> sales representatives sent customers a letter saying We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the Amazing Comeback at Wang How soon Wang will stage a comeback or if it will at all are still matters of debate But Wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face selling the products of a company that is on the ropes If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you re not feeling as if you re backed up by a stable company you ve lost it before you ve begun says Mary Ann Cluggish a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellesley Mass</ENAMEX> sales trainer and consultant who works with high technology companies It can happen in any industry Consider the difficulties faced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> dealers problems in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valdez</ENAMEX> oil spill Like thousands of salespeople before them Wang s are finding ways to combat the bad news It s very important that we exude confidence even though within the family we know there s a lot of hard work ahead said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Miller</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lowell Mass</ENAMEX> computer concern s new president in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers Last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising After the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter Wang s marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as How could you not have known you were going to lose 55 million and Is Wang still a viable company Salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances Responding to such questions is defensive says Kenneth Olissa Wang s vice president marketing That s antithetical to the art of selling Moreover he notes that analyzing financial results poses a problem for a salesman who isn t particularly familiar with a balance sheet At one sales strategy meeting an executive suggested ordering salespeople to become experts on the annual report <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> vetoed that Even I can t understand all the footnotes he says Instead he says if the salespeople can get the customers to consider Wang s products on their merits he or a top financial officer will try to assuage the fears about finances <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Metschan</ENAMEX> a salesman in Wang s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin Texas</ENAMEX> office has a breezier method We tell them 3 billion companies don t go out of business We tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines but very few have had losses comparable to Wang s or are carrying such a large debt load <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> says that after a sharp sales slump in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> sales stabilized in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> Although Wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept 30 and the full fiscal year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble it will be a problem for the long run says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">George Palmatier</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minden Nev</ENAMEX> sales consultant and author of The Marketing Edge Still says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sullivan</ENAMEX> a management recruiter with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Roberts Inc</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> who has held senior sales positions at Polaroid and Atari The customer will react to strength Ignore the present condition Show it s business as usual That isn t easy Wang s customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come For buyers these are career risking decisions says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Conlin</ENAMEX> who supervises a network of Wang computers in the admissions department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston University</ENAMEX> The university is considering installing a 250 000 system to store applications electronically Before the really bad news we were looking at Wang fairly seriously she says But their present financial condition means I d have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing Ms Conlin adds At some point we d have to ask How do we know that in three years you won t be in Chapter 11 During the past year Wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president Wang s overall product line is still not as good as other vendors but they ve come a long way says Steven Wendler a consultant with market researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gartner Group Stamford Conn</ENAMEX> They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened The first priority for Wang s sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers Wang s installed base is one of its greatest assets and many of those customers remain extremely loyal But even before Wang s latest financial troubles surfaced some customers were trying to wall off their Wang installations so other departments wouldn t add Wang says Chris Christiansen a former Wang marketer who is now a market analyst with Meta Group a market research firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stamford Conn One Wang</ENAMEX> salesman who left the company in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> recalls that when he tried to sell products to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak</ENAMEX> he worked to muster support from internal allies but those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend The more recent losses were really devastating New customers the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to Wang s long term viability are even tougher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Lynch</ENAMEX> a former top salesman in Wang s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> office referring to Wang s mainstay computer line says You can t sell a VS to a new customer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lynch</ENAMEX> left Wang this summer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle Systems Inc</ENAMEX> a software vendor The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing Wang s image systems which convert paper forms to electronic documents Consultants say that Wang s technology is among the best available in the image market But salespeople often found that news of Wang s problems superseded their sales efforts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Tait</ENAMEX> a former sales manager in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> says that his office had all but sold a 1 5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly Co</ENAMEX> When they were making the decision all hell broke loose with the finances He says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> executives told him they couldn t take the risk with Wang Mr Tait say he doesn t blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly Buyers</ENAMEX> have to rely on a supplier continually upgrading and replacing the product he says When a company realizes that it s hard to go with Wang For Mr Tait who says he used to earn as much as 150 000 a year at Wang it was one more reason to quit He is now president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastate Homes Inc</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> contractor It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Petre</ENAMEX> a former Wang salesman in upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> says You have pride in your job You think you can go out and turn things around It s a tough thing when you can t The reason doesn t relate to your selling skills Discouragement feeds on itself The problem is if people get down in the dumps they stop selling says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Durcan</ENAMEX> a laid off sales manager in Wang s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> office One key for salespeople is to boost their own morale <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Hellman</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framingham Mass</ENAMEX> sales and management consultant and author of Ready Aim You re Hired says The bad news is you ll be rejected more The good news is it s not your fault So he advises make goals achievable For instance he suggests that salespeople making telephone calls should say to themselves All I want to do today is get 50 rejections But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller Wang</ENAMEX> s new president recently warned his salespeople about negativism Our customers watch us for the hidden message he said Look a customer right in the eye and say I m glad to be at <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Wang</ENAMEX>
