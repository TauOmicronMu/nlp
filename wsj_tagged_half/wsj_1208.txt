The stock market went on a dizzying ride as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Airlines once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback At the end of it all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> closed down 3 69 to 2659 22 At one point yesterday morning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> was down 80 53 points <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume was 237 960 000 shares Declining issues swamped advancers 1 222 to 382 Yesterday s sell off and rebound was a powerful reminder that 11 days after the 190 point plunge on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> the 13th the stock market still has a bad case of nerves Takeover stock speculation and futures related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges And there is more volatility to come October 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Solomon</ENAMEX> technical analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns People</ENAMEX> are fearful and sensitive Everybody s finger is one inch closer to the button I have never had as many calls as I had this morning Volatility is here to stay The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> plunged about 80 points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell For many it began to look like a replay of Oct 13 As stocks and stock index futures fell a trading limit was hit in the S P 500 stock futures pit Under a post 1987 crash reform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> wouldn t permit the December S P futures to fall further than 12 points for a half hour That caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> But at a critical moment stock index arbitrage traders showed their power and control They scooped up hundreds of S P futures when the market needed it most At about 10 40 a m <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX> several big buy orders hit the S P pit simultaneously lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer driven program buying of stocks It is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected said one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> based futures trader These guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are Traders said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> declined to comment Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> were unavailable for comment As in the Oct 13 massacre yesterday morning s drop was triggered by bad news for speculators in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL A UAL</ENAMEX> statement after the market closed Monday indicated that the airline s board wanted to keep the company independent effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy out Five minutes before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> opened a preliminary price was flashed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> somewhere between 135 and 155 a loss of as much as 43 a share from Monday s close <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> finally opened for trading at 10 08 a m at 150 down 28 Floor traders said there was a huge crowd around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> specialist s post where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trades There was a seething mass of people said one floor trader Then there was a big liquidation of stock across the board he added Takeover speculators who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than 700 million on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> started selling other stocks as well as S P futures in an attempt to hedge against a further <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> blood bath Shortly after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> opening program traders started selling stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major Market Index</ENAMEX> and S P 500 index The 20 stock MMI mimics the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> By 10 30 a m the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> was down 62 70 All 20 stocks in the MMI except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon General</ENAMEX> Motors and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> were down 1 to 2 At 10 33 when the S P 500 December futures contract crunched to a 12 point loss under the force of sell programs S P futures trading was halted and program trades on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances Under the rules adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> the futures contract can not drop below the limit but buyers can purchase futures At this point the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials were down 75 41 points and falling The trading halt in the S P 500 futures exacerbated selling and confusion many traders maintain But as the fright began to spread through the S P pit the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively It was whooosh said one futures trader In five minutes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials climbed almost 30 points The big futures buying triggered stock index buy programs that eventually trimmed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> s loss to 31 points by 11 a m Traders said the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders These firms sold stock into the big morning decline but seeing the velocity of the market s drop held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the S P futures hit the trading limit Then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures which abruptly halted the stock market s decline as traders began to buy stocks From then on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials held at a loss of 40 to 50 points Then in late afternoon trading hundred thousand share buy orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> hit the market including a 200 000 share order through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> that seemed to spark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> s late price surge Almost simultaneously <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks The combined buying rallied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> into a small gain before closing at a slight loss Some institutional traders loved the wild ride This is fun asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Del Signore</ENAMEX> head equity trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Investment Management Co</ENAMEX> She said she used the market s wild swings to buy shares cheaply on the sell off On the comeback <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ms Del Signore</ENAMEX> unloaded shares she has been aiming to get rid of But traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken This market is eating away my youth said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung Lew</ENAMEX> head equity trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kleinwort Benson North America Inc Credibility</ENAMEX> sounds intangible But I think we are losing credibility because when the market does this it doesn t present itself as a rational investment But if you overlook all this it is a beautiful market for investment still Traders attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a Japanese buy program that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Professional Investor Report Dow Jones</ENAMEX> climbed 5 3 4 to 41 on very heavy volume of 786 100 shares Analysts said a big Japanese buy order was behind the rise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Dow Jones</ENAMEX> spokesman said there were no corporate developments that would account for the activity Other issues said to be included in the buy program were Procter Gamble which rose 2 7 8 to 133 1 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX> which gained 2 to 103 3 4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell
