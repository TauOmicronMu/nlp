<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Part III</ENAMEX> is scheduled to begin today After two mistrials the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Corp</ENAMEX> and its vice chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James T Sherwin</ENAMEX> have changed considerably The first two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trials were watched closely on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> because they were considered to be important tests of the government s ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider trading investigations In an eight count indictment the government charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wayne N J</ENAMEX> chemical maker and Mr Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide Corp</ENAMEX> in advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> s planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986 The government s credibility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> case depended heavily on its star witness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd L Jefferies</ENAMEX> the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky and then pointed the finger at Mr Sherwin takeover speculator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salim B Lewis</ENAMEX> and corporate raider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Bilzerian</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trials were viewed as previews of the government s strength in its cases against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lewis</ENAMEX> and Mr Bilzerian Mr Jefferies s performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> s bellwether role was short lived The first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe</ENAMEX> found that a prosecutor improperly but unintentionally withheld a document After 93 hours of deliberation the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked and another mistrial was declared on March 22 Meanwhile a federal jury found Mr Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June A month later Mr Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">August Mr Lewis</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to three felony counts Nevertheless the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> case The mistrials have left the reputations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Mr Sherwin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman</ENAMEX> in limbo For Mr Sherwin a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a 250 000 fine on each count <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> faces potential fines of 500 000 for each count Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial but by the end of the month the talks had ended There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> s attorney Arthur Liman and Mr Sherwin s counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Kaufman</ENAMEX> will include testimony by Mr Sherwin or Mr Heyman Neither testified at the previous trials For now defense attorneys are tight lipped about their plans <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Gitter</ENAMEX> another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> defense attorney said yesterday As we go in for the third time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX> s famous line is apt It s deja vu all over again DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization plan appeal Attorneys for more than 18 000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy law reorganization plan for A H Robins Co which manufactured the device The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael A Pretl</ENAMEX> and 17 other attorneys representing 18 136 claimants in the U S and abroad argue that the appeal would delay and perhaps even destroy a 2 38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan The bankruptcy court reorganization is being challenged before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims It also bars future suits against Robins company officials members of the Robins family and Robins s former insurer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life Casualty Co</ENAMEX> The latter provision is legally unprecedented said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan B Morrison</ENAMEX> a public interest lawyer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington D C</ENAMEX> who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants More than 100 000 claims against Robins are pending The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U S Bankruptcy Code since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> 1985 such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home</ENAMEX> Products Corp wants to acquire Robins but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted In a brief filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> last week Mr Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising abstract and theoretical legal issues while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> is scheduled to consider the case Nov 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov 6 JURY S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles A Donohoo</ENAMEX> sole proprieter of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville Ky</ENAMEX> demolition company was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clean Air Act Criminal</ENAMEX> convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case Under Superfund those who owned generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment In 1986 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> strengthened the penalty by making it a felony Mr Donohoo was convicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> The government sought a criminal penalty because no cleanup is possible here Once asbestos is released into the environment it can lodge anywhere says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A Dennis</ENAMEX> the assistant U S attorney who prosecuted the case Mr Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec 11 His lawyer could not be reached for comment Mr Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a 250 000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a 100 000 fine for the violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clean Air Act TED BUNDY S LAWYERS</ENAMEX> switch to victims side in death sentence case Wilmer Cutler Pickering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington D C</ENAMEX> law firm that spent over 1 million fighting the execution of mass murderer Ted Bundy who eventually was executed has taken on another death penalty case before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> The law firm has filed a friend of the court brief jointly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> a conservative legal group The key issue in the case which the law firm is handling without a fee or pro bono is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review The murderer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Gene Simmons</ENAMEX> was convicted of killing 14 people Another murderer on death row has appealed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Simmons</ENAMEX> s death sentence in a next friend capacity Wilmer Cutler s brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing P J Mode Wilmer Cutler s managing partner says the trial team that represented Mr Bundy was asked by the firm s pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised The coupling of the law firm and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> is odd also because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work We give them a lot of credit for taking this case says WLF s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Slobodin THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS</ENAMEX> In federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salvador Dali</ENAMEX> lithographs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Burke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Evans</ENAMEX> formerly owners of the now defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barclay Gallery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence Clark</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barclay</ENAMEX> sales representative were charged with conducting high pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed limited edition lithographs The posters were sold for 1 300 to 6 000 although the government says they had a value of only 53 to 200 apiece <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Pitman</ENAMEX> the assistant U S attorney handling the case said about 1 000 customers were defrauded and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barclay</ENAMEX> s total proceeds from the sales were 3 4 million Attorneys for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs Burke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> and Ms Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr Dali who died in January The posters were printed on paper pre signed by Mr Dali the attorneys said
