Law firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines The disarray in the junk bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp</ENAMEX> and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Airlines parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp</ENAMEX> has reverberated through some of the nation s largest law firms While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work which has been so lucrative in the past Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do you can t bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish says one lawyer at a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm We re planning on a rip roaring year in 1989 but next year we ll be another story said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Freedman</ENAMEX> a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson Thacher Bartlett</ENAMEX> We re settling down to a less active period Lawyers at such firms as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan Cromwell Willkie Farr Gallagher Wachtell Lipton Rosen Katz</ENAMEX> and Fried Frank Harris Shriver Jacobson all say they too have experienced a significant slowdown particularly during the past few weeks Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nusbaum</ENAMEX> co chairman of Willkie Farr It s hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical Some lawyers say the slump while more obvious in recent weeks began earlier this year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Block</ENAMEX> a partner at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weil Gotshal Manges</ENAMEX> said that in the first eight months of this year 89 hostile offers were launched compared with 157 for the first eight months of What s more he said transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing and more stringent scrutiny by state courts Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed Still some lawyers say the mergers slowdown hasn t affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones We just took another floor for our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> offices said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Flom</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom Davis Polk Wardwell</ENAMEX> also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy European companies are looking to buy American ones said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry King</ENAMEX> the managing partner at that firm But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions MURDER THREAT charged in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haas</ENAMEX> Securities Corp stock manipulation trial In the trial of former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haas</ENAMEX> Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chairman Eugene Laff</ENAMEX> the defense accused one of the government s chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr Laff Mr Laff s

told a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haas</ENAMEX> stockbroker that Mr Laff should be killed The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr Lang said was an effort to get Mr Lorin to implicate Mr Laff In his opening arguments last week in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Mr Lang</ENAMEX> told the jury that Mr Lorin was the real master criminal behind the stock manipulation and that Mr Laff knew nothing about it In March Mr Laff was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy mail and securities fraud and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and <ENAMEX

microphone during the conversation also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate According to the transcript Mr Lorin said Mr Laff should be killed after Mr Aslanian told him that information given to Mr Laff by another conspirator could jeopardize the stock scheme Mr Lorin then repeated the threat and Mr Aslanian urged him not to say such things From the parts of the transcript read by Mr Lang it was unclear what exactly Mr Lorin feared might happen When asked for a copy of the transcript Mr Lang said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judge Thomas P Griesa</ENAMEX> had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum During the trial Mr Lang asked Mr Lorin whether he had been so upset that you considered killing Mr Laff Isn t it true that you were so worked up that framing Mr Laff for this crime was the least that you planned for him Mr Lorin responded No When Mr Lang asked Mr Lorin whether he had taken steps to have Mr Laff killed the witness again said no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lieb</ENAMEX> the assistant U S attorney prosecuting the case declined to comment on the trial TRUSTEE WHO MONITORED
