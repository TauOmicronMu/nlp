We read with interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Tomsho</ENAMEX> s Sept 28 page one article on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance Kid</ENAMEX> Gets Little Respect Around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance Misunderstanding</ENAMEX> conversations with us <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Tomsho</ENAMEX> argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Redford</ENAMEX> s environmental views are at odds with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> residents This may have been true 10 years ago but times have changed even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah Mr Redford</ENAMEX> no longer stands out as an extremist He has not changed but those around him have Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream conservative Utahans Recently some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> the League of Women Voters and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Rifle Association</ENAMEX> joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Utah Project</ENAMEX> While <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> is not yet a haven for environmentalism public views toward the environment have significantly improved In one of the most conservative Republican states in the entire nation the greening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> s neighbors is the real story that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Tomsho</ENAMEX> missed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sammye Meadows Sam Rushforth Gary Bryner Heber City Utah</ENAMEX> If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Redford</ENAMEX> wanted to be accepted by the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences Furthermore his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power plant construction coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wasatch Range</ENAMEX> into a ski resort It astounds me he can rationalize his self righteous and greedy actions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> An excellent environmental actor he is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David Vranian M B A Student University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Boulder Colo Mr Redford</ENAMEX> like it or not is like a braking system on a runaway truck kind of slowing it down into control He s rich famous and intelligent and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Redford</ENAMEX> is slowing down a mindless speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind Personally I m glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit takers and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future not caring about the long range implications <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Dyer</ENAMEX>
