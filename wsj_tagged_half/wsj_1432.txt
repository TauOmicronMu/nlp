For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cathay Pacific</ENAMEX> Airways the smooth ride may be ending The first signs of trouble came last month when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> carrier a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Swire Pacific Ltd</ENAMEX> posted a 5 drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year Securities analysts many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay s interim figures believe more jolts lie ahead Fuel and personnel costs are rising and tourism in and through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> remains clouded by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s turmoil since the June 4 killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> In addition delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes And tough competition in the air freight market is cutting into an important sideline There also is concern that once <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> reverts to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s sovereignty in 1997 Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s often disparaged flag carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> or CAAC The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before says Rod Eddington Cathay s commercial director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Hall</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">James Capel Far East Ltd</ENAMEX> says there isn t much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> s tight labor market or the strengthening of the local currency which is pegged to the U S dollar These factors are further complicated by the airline s push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Hall</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Hall</ENAMEX> expects Cathay s profit to grow around 13 annually this year and next In 1988 it earned 2 82 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong US</ENAMEX> 361 5 million on revenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HK</ENAMEX> 11 79 billion Cathay is taking several steps to bolster business One step is to beef up its fleet In addition to aircraft from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co Cathay</ENAMEX> announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330 300s The expansion which could cost as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> 5 7 billion over the next eight years will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991 up from 30 at the end of last year according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Hung Kai</ENAMEX> Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ltd</ENAMEX> The fuel efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay s aging fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Tristars</ENAMEX> for regional flights while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> aircraft will be used on long haul routes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America Cathay</ENAMEX> also is moving some of its labor intensive data processing operations outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong Fierce</ENAMEX> bidding for young employees in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is pushing up Cathay s labor costs by 20 a year for low level staff while experienced skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain Some jobs already have been moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and there are plans to place others in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada David Bell</ENAMEX> a spokesman for the airline says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 Cathay is working to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as a destination worth visiting on its own merits rather than just a stopover Although the June 4 killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> have hurt its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> flights Cathay s other routes have retained high load factors Mr Eddington regards promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as an important part of attracting visitors from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private sector participants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government s plans to build a new airport with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation Mr Eddington sees alliances with other carriers particularly Cathay s recent link with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> Airlines as an important part of Cathay s strategy But he emphasizes that Cathay hasn t any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U S carrier or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers We think alliances are very important Mr Eddington says But we d rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else s I m not sure cross ownership would necessarily make things smoother In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U S destinations Cathay recently announced plans to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> by flying into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> Airlines <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U S carrier We ll never have a big operation in the U S and they ll never have one as big as us in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Mr Eddington</ENAMEX> says But this way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> will coordinate good extensions to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston New York Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> We ll coordinate on this end to places like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bangkok Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila Asian</ENAMEX> traffic which currently accounts for 65 of Cathay s business is expected to continue as the carrier s mainstay Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> to 14 and it is applying to restart long canceled flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam Further</ENAMEX> expansion into southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> is also possible says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Bell</ENAMEX> the spokesman While a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997 such a move isn t an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> And Mr Eddington emphatically rules out a move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> Our lifeblood is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> traffic rights He says the airline is putting its faith in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sino British</ENAMEX> agreement on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> s return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China A</ENAMEX> special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> s airlines which include the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong Dragon</ENAMEX> Airlines will continue to be negotiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> s government But critics fret that post 1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing My</ENAMEX> feeling is Cathay doesn t have a hope in the long run says an analyst who declines to be identified Cathay would love to keep going but the general sense is they re going to have to do something Mr Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes but he feels that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sino</ENAMEX> British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future We re confident that it protects our route structure he says and our ability to grow and prosper
