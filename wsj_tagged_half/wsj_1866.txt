Two years of coddling down the drain That s the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash Ever since that fearful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Monday</ENAMEX> they ve been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors trying to convince them that Oct 19 1987 was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard earned dollars And until last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off Some of those folks were coming back says Leslie Quick Jr chairman of discount brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quick Reilly Group Inc</ENAMEX> We had heard from people who hadn t been active for a long time Then came the frightening 190 point plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> and a new wave of stock market volatility All of a sudden it was back to square one It s going to set things back for a period because it reinforces the concern of volatility says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey B Lane</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> I think it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence Brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post crash 1987 The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond A Chip Mason</ENAMEX> chairman of regional brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Legg Mason Inc Baltimore</ENAMEX> I can just tell the questions are right back where they were What s going on Can t anything be done about program trading Doesn t the exchange understand Where is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mason</ENAMEX> says he s convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe the deck is stacked against them But these wide swings scare them to death All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Co</ENAMEX> that have big retail or individual investor businesses After expanding rapidly during the bull market years up to the 1987 crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead True the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately But those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which don t generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms At discount brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schwab Co</ENAMEX> such cash equivalent investments recently accounted for a record 8 billion of the firm s 25 billion of client s assets The brokers hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market And before last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> they were actually making modest progress A slightly higher percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post crash 1988 according to Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry Association</ENAMEX> data In 1987 an average 19 7 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than 21 4 The retail participation dropped to an average 18 2 in 1988 and shriveled to barely 14 some months during the year Yet in 1989 retail participation has been more than 20 in every month and was 23 5 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> the latest month for which figures are available <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Schaefer</ENAMEX> the SIA s research director says that all of his group s retail volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy backs are sometimes inadvertently included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> data But there did seem to be a retail activity pickup But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> didn t help things says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Schaefer</ENAMEX> With the gyrations of recent days says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Quackenbush</ENAMEX> senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schwab</ENAMEX> many small investors are absolutely convinced that they shouldn t play in the stock market Joseph Grano president of retail sales and marketing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group Inc</ENAMEX> still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market Investors will develop thicker skins and their confidence will return he says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> s plunge he is telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> brokers was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy out stocks Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> their money It s more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities Mr Grano says The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there s a semblance of confidence It could be a long wait say some industry observers Some investors will tiptoe back in says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ross</ENAMEX> a market research director for Elrick Lavidge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> Then there ll be another swing Given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most hardy he adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ross</ENAMEX> who has been studying retail investors perception of risks in the brokerage industry said a market plunge like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> s shatters investors confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market The long term outlook for the retail brokerage business is miserable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ross</ENAMEX> declares
