Two leading constitutional law experts said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> doesn t have the legal authority to exercise a line item veto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Professors Philip Kurland</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Tribe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX> said any effort by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> to claim authority for a line item veto would contradict the text of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> and the intent of its authors as well as the views of previous presidents A line item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> has said he would like to be able to use this procedure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A White House</ENAMEX> spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> implicitly gives him the authority for a line item veto to provoke a test case But the two legal experts responding to an inquiry by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Edward Kennedy D Mass</ENAMEX> wrote in a joint letter that the president lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line item veto The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kurland</ENAMEX> is a conservative and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Tribe</ENAMEX> is a liberal The two professors said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> authorizes the president to veto entire bills not partial measures Moreover they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items and there was no discussion of a line item veto They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line item veto authority since the Civil War and all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach of the president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Kennedy</ENAMEX> said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line item veto power but that it would be a reckless course of action for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> to claim the authority without congressional approval
