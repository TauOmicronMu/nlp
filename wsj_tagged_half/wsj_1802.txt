B A T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said The British conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a 13 35 billion 21 03 billion takeover bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anglo French</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value boosting measures If anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in B A T s share price since last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> s sharp <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> sell off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thank God</ENAMEX> we have some deal on the table said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart Gilchrist</ENAMEX> a director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Amicable Investment</ENAMEX> Managers which intends to vote its roughly 1 stake in favor of the restructuring Investors in B A T have been on a roller coaster B A T has been <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> s best performing blue chip over the past six months up 40 against a 4 rise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 100 Share Index But this week B A T has been hit harder than other big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> stocks first by the market gyrations then by Tuesday s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake which could leave B A T s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc</ENAMEX> insurance unit facing big claims B A T rose five pence eight cents to 756 pence 11 91 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28 pence fall earlier in the day To fight off predators B A T plans to spin off about 6 billion in assets largely by selling such U S retailing units as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> and by floating its big paper and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> retailing business via share issues to existing holders Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy back of 10 of its shares and a 50 dividend increase I think the restructuring will get the required support said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Pacitti</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stockbroker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UBS Phillips Drew</ENAMEX> The shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy back But B A T s restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Company</ENAMEX> officials holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year s first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half We aren t forced sellers We don t have an absolute deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Prideaux</ENAMEX> a B A T spokesman Even if B A T receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may unfold over the next 12 months rather than six The new B A T will be a smaller tobacco and financial services hybrid whose price earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower growth tobacco business than the higher multiple financial services business these holders believe Thus B A T s restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators possibly such acquisitive bidders as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanson PLC</ENAMEX> The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says Scottish Amicable s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gilchrist</ENAMEX> But I wouldn t write off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir James</ENAMEX> or other potential bidders Among possible delays the sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season may slide into the second quarter or second half Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly 2 billion B A T isn t predicting a postponement because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries said Mr Prideaux But the delay could happen if B A T doesn t get adequate bids he said People familiar with B A T say possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains and General Cinema Corp which is interested in bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> Other potential bidders for parts of B A T s U S retail unit include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard Department</ENAMEX> Stores <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc May Department</ENAMEX> Stores Co and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited Inc B A T</ENAMEX> has declined to identify the potential bidders Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir James</ENAMEX> has said he intends to mount a new bid for B A T once approval from U S insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk bond financing and U S leverage buy outs are making investors more skeptical about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir James</ENAMEX> s prospects His initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as 80 of the takeover financing through the debt markets Market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for B A T s attracting a premium price for its U S retailing properties Finally Tuesday s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake initially knocked 3 7 off B A T s share price in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> based Farmers which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> On Farmers Mr Prideaux said it is too early to quantify the level of potential claims He added B A T has no expectation of a material impact on Farmers
