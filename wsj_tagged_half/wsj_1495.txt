<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">David Baltimore</ENAMEX> who has just been named president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller University</ENAMEX> already knows what it s like to go through life with Nobel laureate appended to one s name He is currently experiencing what it s like to have the phrase under investigation for scientific fraud also attached to his name The Nobel committee made the first addition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> s congressional committee created the second Both of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Baltimore</ENAMEX> s public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> research institution It came to light that a substantial number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> s faculty were upset over or even opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Baltimore</ENAMEX> s impending appointment They were disturbed at what they regarded as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Baltimore</ENAMEX> s confrontational attitude toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> committee which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co authored a scientific paper with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Baltimore Readers</ENAMEX> of these columns The Science Police May 15 will recall that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Baltimore</ENAMEX> was merely the most well known part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> committee s larger investigation which touched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT Tufts Duke</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> Institutes of Health and elsewhere <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Dingell</ENAMEX> even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> paper Insofar as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dingell</ENAMEX> has a special interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> and the institutions that receive its funding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> scientists were no doubt discomfited by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Baltimore</ENAMEX> s unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron whose behavior reminded <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Baltimore</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccarthy</ENAMEX> era This well may be the first time that the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller University</ENAMEX> has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> demagogues a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">David Baltimore</ENAMEX> animal rights activists do 3 5 million of damage to labs at the U cal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis Meryl Streep</ENAMEX> decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments and Dutch elm disease researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Strobel</ENAMEX> s own colleagues at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana State</ENAMEX> denounce him for violating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> rules Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti science movement in this country isn t their concern or that a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">David Baltimore</ENAMEX> could have somehow placated a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell Mr Dingell</ENAMEX> by the way has decreed another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> paper adding to several previous investigations Something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here Fortunately there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hubel</ENAMEX> a Nobel laureate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> has taken the lead in defending research with animals as has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Michael Debakey NASA</ENAMEX> defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit to block the Galileo launch Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good today it is also about power In a media linked world scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content funding and goals of that work When a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">David Baltimore</ENAMEX> or the next target decides it is better to stand up to these forces his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake and offer their public support
