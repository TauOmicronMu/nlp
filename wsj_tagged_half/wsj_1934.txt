A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> according to researchers The drug which is still in the experimental phase hasn t been approved yet by the Food and Drug Admistration and its long term effects are unknown But researchers say the drug called FK 506 could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30 000 organ transplants performed world wide each year Researchers began using the drug in February on patients who had received kidney liver heart and pancreas transplants Only two of 111 transplants have been rejected The drug discovered in 1984 is metabolized from soil fungus found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> patients are the first humans to be given the drug which is made by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co We re shocked by it because it s worked so fast said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Thomas E Starzl</ENAMEX> director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh Transplantation Program</ENAMEX> at a news conference here yesterday We consider it a life saving drug like one for AIDS said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr John Fung</ENAMEX> an immunologist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh Researchers</ENAMEX> say they believe FK 506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti rejection drug cyclosporine made by Swiss pharmaceutical giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandoz Ltd</ENAMEX> They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK 506 compared with cyclosporine which can cause renal failure morbidity nausea and other problems The side effects of cyclosporine have made the penalty for its success rather high Dr Starzl said Dr Fung said that FK 506 would not be available in the market for at least a year and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval process usually takes three years to five years There are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world Researchers couldn t estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market but they said FK 506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50 and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients Dr Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute</ENAMEX> of Health and by university funds and that Fujisawa didn t give the hospital any grants He said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug We ve known for six months the effect of this drug and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company s stock Dr Starzl said adding that profiting from FK 506 wouldn t be ethical
