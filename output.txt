Fields PLC</ENAMEX> was named a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerateA form of asbestos once used to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kent</ENAMEX> cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago researchers reported The asbestos fiber crocidolite is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorillard Inc</ENAMEX> the unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loews Corp</ENAMEX> that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kent</ENAMEX> cigarettes stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England Journal</ENAMEX> of Medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Lorillard</ENAMEX> spokewoman said This is an old story We re talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties There is no asbestos in our products now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neither Lorillard</ENAMEX> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kent</ENAMEX> cigarettes We have no useful information on whether users are at risk said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A Talcott</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dana Farber Cancer Institute Dr Talcott</ENAMEX> led a team of researchers from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> and the medical schools of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston University</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorillard</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 From 1953 to 1955 9 8 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kent</ENAMEX> cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance 28 have died more than three times the expected number Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos related diseases including three with recently diagnosed cancer The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected the researchers said The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos related diseases said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Talcott</ENAMEX> The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Groton Mass</ENAMEX> paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries he said The plant which is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollingsworth Vose Co</ENAMEX> was under contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorillard</ENAMEX> to make the cigarette filters The finding probably will support those who argue that the U S should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos chrysotile found in most schools and other buildings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Talcott</ENAMEX> said The U S is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn t have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth needle like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooke T Mossman</ENAMEX> a professor of pathlogy at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont College</ENAMEX> of Medicine More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Mossman</ENAMEX> explained In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos By 1997 almost all remaining uses of cancer causing asbestos will be outlawed About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kent</ENAMEX> filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters Workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though exhaust fans ventilated the area There s no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos related diseases said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darrell Phillips</ENAMEX> vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth Vose But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago It has no bearing on our work force todayYields on money market mutual funds continued to slide amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates The average seven day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBC</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> eased a

funds investments lengthened by a day to 41 days the longest since early <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue</ENAMEX> s Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner The average maturity for funds open only to institutions considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely reached a high point for the year 33 days Nevertheless said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Malizia Negus</ENAMEX> editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> yields

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newgate Management</ENAMEX> Associates of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northampton Mass</ENAMEX> The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the closed end fund mania of the 1920s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Foot</ENAMEX> says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash Unlike traditional open end mutual funds most of these one country portfolios are the closed end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets People are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Porter</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Smith Barney Harris Upham Co New York Behind</ENAMEX> all the hoopla is some heavy duty competition As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets such as the U S and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan Country</ENAMEX> funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies But it doesn t take much to get burned Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds Another concern The funds share prices tend to swing more than the broader market When the stock market dropped nearly 7 Oct 13 for instance the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico Fund</ENAMEX> plunged about 18 and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain Fund</ENAMEX> fell 16 And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash What s so wild about the funds frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios After trading at an average discount of more than 20 in late 1987 and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6 The reason Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold It s probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> some specialists say But some European funds recently have skyrocketed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain Fund</ENAMEX> has surged to a startling 120 premium It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long term play tied to 1992 s European economic integration And several new funds that aren t even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums I m very alarmed to see these rich valuations says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Porter</ENAMEX> The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Porter</ENAMEX> suggests Unlike many U S investors those in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> seeking foreign stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Porter</ENAMEX> says Nonetheless plenty of U S analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds They argue that U S investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these so called Adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U S That way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium For people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newgate</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Foot</ENAMEX> says The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quicklyThe U S and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> are holding technical talks about possible repayment by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> of 188 million in pre <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Russian</ENAMEX> debts owed to the U S government the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> said If the debts are repaid it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U S However after two meetings with the Soviets a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> spokesman said that it s too early to say whether that will happen Coincident with the talks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> branch The branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Economic Affairs</ENAMEX> was approved last spring and opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> found a way to settle the 188 million debt which was lent to the country s short lived democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerensky</ENAMEX> government before the Communists seized power in 1917 Under a 1934 law the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson Debt Default Act</ENAMEX> as amended it s illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U S government unless they are members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> The U S S R belongs to neither organization <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> has settled pre 1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> stressed the pre 1933 debts as the key to satisfying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Act</ENAMEX> But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U S until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend lease programIn another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> Meanwhile the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purchasing Management</ENAMEX> said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month Its index inched up to 47 6 in October from 46 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September Any</ENAMEX> reading below 50 suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining The purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline Factories booked 236 74 billion in orders in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> nearly the same as the 236 79 billion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said If not for a 59 6 surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen 2 1 In a separate report the

construction spending was down but government building activity was up The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but weren t adjusted for inflation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Mayland</ENAMEX> economist for Society Corp a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off At the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack he asked I draw a blank By most measures the nation s industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all Factory payrolls fell in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September So</ENAMEX> did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> s industrial production index Yet many economists aren t predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession They cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn Inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession But yesterday s factory orders report had good news on that front it said factory inventories fell 0 1 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> the first decline since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX> 1987 This conforms to the soft landing scenario said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Platt</ENAMEX> an economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp</ENAMEX> I don t see any signs that inventories are excessive A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession The department said orders for nondurable goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell 0 3 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> to 109 73 billion after climbing 0 9 the month before Orders for durable goods were up 0 2 to 127 03 billion after rising 3 9 the month before The department previously estimated that durable goods orders fell 0 1 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September Factory</ENAMEX> shipments fell 1 6 to 234 4 billion after rising 5 4 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> Shipments have been relatively level since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> the

in the defense capital goods sector Excluding these orders backlogs declined 0 3 In its construction spending report the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off 0 9 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> to an annual rate of 191 9 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Berson</ENAMEX> economist for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mortgage Bankers Association</ENAMEX> predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single family homes but probably not until early next year Spending on private nonresidential construction was off 2 6 to an annual rate of 99 1 billion with no sector showing strength Government construction spending rose 4 3 to 88 billion After adjusting for inflation the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said construction spending didn t change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> For the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about 2 above last year s level The government s construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgraw Hill Inc</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F W Dodge Group Dodge</ENAMEX> reported an 8 increase in construction contracts awarded in <ENAMEX

on residential renovation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> doesn t Although the purchasing managers index continues to indicate a slowing economy it isn t signaling an imminent recession said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bretz</ENAMEX> chairman of the association s survey committee and director of materials management at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pitney Bowes Inc Stamford Conn</ENAMEX> He said the index would have to be in the low 40 range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession The report offered new evidence that the nation s export growth though still continuing may be slowing Only 19 of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October down from 27 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> And 8 said export orders were down last month compared with 6 the month before The purhasing managers report also added evidence that inflation is under control For the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell The decline was even steeper than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen prices tend to rise The purchasing managers report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives Each of the survey s indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening For the first time the October survey polled members on imports It found that of the 73 who import 10 said they imported more in October and 12 said they imported less than the previous month While acknowledging one month s figures don t prove a trend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bretz</ENAMEX> said It does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one newcomer milk and milk powder It s an odd thing to put on the list <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bretz</ENAMEX> noted He said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk They blamed increased demand for dairy

the regimented office where employees are assigned lunch partners and at home in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark It s probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager

sketch artist a man of the streets Now 13 years later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lane</ENAMEX> has revived his Artist in a full length movie called Sidewalk Stories a poignant piece of work about a modern day tramp Of course if the film contained dialogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lane</ENAMEX> s Artist would be called a homeless person So would the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Tramp</ENAMEX> for that matter I say contained dialogue because Sidewalk Stories isn t really silent at all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Composer Marc Marder</ENAMEX> a college friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lane</ENAMEX> s who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles has prepared an exciting eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles or even words would Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lane</ENAMEX> s film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets though probably no more romanticized than <ENAMEX

clearly is not real life no crack dealers no dead eyed men selling four year old copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> no one curled up in a cardboard box The Artist has his routine He spends his days sketching passers by or trying to At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home His life including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist seems carefree He is his own man Then just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Lights</ENAMEX> the Artist is put in charge of returning a two year old waif <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Alysia</ENAMEX> whose father has been murdered by thugs to her mother This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse She gives the Artist a sense of purpose but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night To further load the stakes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lane</ENAMEX> dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist with a young woman who owns her own children s shop and who lives in an expensive high rise apartment building This story line might resonate more strongly if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lane</ENAMEX> had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lane</ENAMEX> s final purpose isn t to glamorize the Artist s vagabond existence He has a point he wants to make and he makes it with a great deal of force The movie ends with sound the sound of street people talking and there isn t anything whimsical or enviable in those rough beaten voices The French film maker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Chabrol</ENAMEX> has managed another kind of weird achievement with his Story

historical significance both as one of the last women to be executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and as a symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vichy</ENAMEX> government s hypocrisy While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vichy</ENAMEX> collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resistance</ENAMEX> fighters and Jews its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor Marie Louise a small time abortionist was their woman She became an abortionist accidentally and continued because it enabled her to buy jam cocoa and other war

767 the plane could hit the market in the mid 1990sThis is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event The irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year s presidential campaign has come of age in an off off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country But in the three leading political contests of 1989 the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility raising fears that this kind of mudslinging empty of significant issues is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content Now says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Napolitan</ENAMEX> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes tawdry art form in 1988 has reached an entirely new stage To get people s attention these days says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Bailey</ENAMEX> a political consultant your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means confrontational And unlike a few years ago you don t even have to worry whether the ad is truthful In 1989 as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves Take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday

the master of negative TV ads really gets down to business <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately hid his links to a

Doak</ENAMEX> finally unleashed a negative ad of their own The screen shows two distorted unrecognizable photos presumably of two politicians Compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer One says he s for banning cop killer bullets The other has opposed a ban on cop killer bullets One claims he s pro choice The other has opposed a woman s right to choose Funny thing says the kicker both these candidates are named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani Who</ENAMEX> s telling the truth Everybody and nobody It s a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dinkins</ENAMEX> did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it The city s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campaign Finance Board</ENAMEX> has refused to pay <ENAMEX

economic cooperation that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX> Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hormats</ENAMEX> vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs International Corp</ENAMEX> In the past five years Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> to 5 57 billion In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> for example the government s <ENAMEX

other cash rich countries are following <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s lead and pumping capital into the region In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South

contributing to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> s integration but their influence will remain subordinate to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s For recipient countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX> the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth But Asian nations harsh memories of their military domination by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now Because of budget constraints in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> the U S encourages <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> to share economic burdens in the region But it resists yielding political ground In the coming decade analysts say U S Japanese relations will be tested as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> comes to terms with its new status as the region s economic behemoth <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s swelling investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> is part of its economic evolution In the past decade Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export In the 1990s spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world To capture the investment <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asian</ENAMEX> nations will move to accommodate Japanese business These nations internal decisions will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor largest private

into a more cohesive economic region But analysts say Asian cooperation isn t likely to parallel the European Common Market approach Rather Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors

TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> assemble the sets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and export them to Indonesia The effect will be to pull <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hormats</ENAMEX> Countries in the region also are beginning

order is taking shape <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> said The U S with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture But maintaining U S influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> not only outstrips the U S in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries although the U S remains the leading trade partner for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> Moreover the Japanese government now the world s largest aid donor is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U S is While U S officials voice optimism about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s enlarged role in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> they also convey an undertone of caution There s an understanding on the part of the U S that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> has to expand its functions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J Michael Farren</ENAMEX> undersecretary of commerce for trade If they approach it with a benevolent altruistic attitude there will be a net gain for everyone Some Asian nations are apprehensive about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> s demand that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> step up its military spending to ease the U S security burden in the region The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U S s leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U S troop reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea Many Asians</ENAMEX> regard a U S presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence No one wants the U S to pick up its marbles and go home <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hormats</ENAMEX> says For their part <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese

could hardly believe her eyes While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> last March 16 she spotted a student looking at crib sheets She had seen cheating before but these notes were uncanny A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance At the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">World War II Germany</ENAMEX> surrendered before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate House</ENAMEX> conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the <ENAMEX

the test the student was taking In fact the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section The student surrendered the notes but not without a protest My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test he said The teacher in question was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Yeargin</ENAMEX> considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Confronted Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low ability geography classes She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> was fired and prosecuted under an unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> law that makes it a crime to breach test security In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> she pleaded guilty and paid a 500 fine Her alternative was 90 days in jail Her story is partly one of personal downfall She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students but she will probably never teach again In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer of colleagues who say she brought them shame of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly and of school district officials stunned that despite the bald faced nature of her actions she became something of a local martyr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> s case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where high stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat The 1987 statute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> violated was designed to enforce provisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> s school improvement laws Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students scores to win a bonus under the state s 1984 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Improvement Act</ENAMEX> The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student test scores There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Haney</ENAMEX> an education professor and testing specialist at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston College So</ENAMEX> efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise And most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing A 50 state study released in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> by Friends for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albuquerque N M</ENAMEX> school research group concluded that outright cheating by American educators is common The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> did although most are never caught Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> s education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> is revising its security practices And sales of test coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming These materials including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan Mcgraw Hill School Publishing Co</ENAMEX> s Scoring High and Learning Materials are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets according to some recent academic research By using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers Use of Scoring High is widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenville County Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> s school district Experts say there isn t another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> Under the state s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Improvement Act</ENAMEX> low test scores can block students promotions or force entire districts into wrenching state supervised interventions that can mean firings High test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the superintendent And <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> says it is getting results Since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination Critics say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much Friends of Education rates <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating Says the organization s founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cannell</ENAMEX> prosecuting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> is a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they don t take it seriously at all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Sandifer</ENAMEX> director of testing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> department of education says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Cannell</ENAMEX> s allegations of cheating are purely without foundation and based on unfair inferences Partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement test preparation booklets next spring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> s reforms were designed for schools like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville High School Standing</ENAMEX> on a shaded hill in a run down area of this old textile city the school has educated many of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> s best and brightest including the state s last two governors Nobel Prize winning physicist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Townes</ENAMEX> and actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanne Woodward</ENAMEX> But by the early 1980s its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Ward</ENAMEX> the school s principal Crime was awful test scores were low and there was no enrollment in honors programs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> took over in 1986 becoming the school s seventh principal in 15 years Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown Prior to his term a teacher bled to death in the halls stabbed by a student Academically <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> says the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate and evenly split student groups a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from run down inner city neighborhoods <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> resolved to clean out deadwood in the school s faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf One was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment Another was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Yeargin</ENAMEX> who came to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX> in 1985 full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward Being a teacher just became my life says the 37 year old Mrs Yeargin a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal I loved the school its history I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> worked 14 hour days and fast became a student favorite In 1986 87 and 1987 88 she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law Encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> taught honor students in the state teacher cadet program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career She won grant money for the school advised cheerleaders ran the pep club proposed and taught a new Cultural Literacy class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTA</ENAMEX> as Teacher of the Year She was an inspirational lady she had it all together says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Dobson</ENAMEX> a freshman at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> who had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> in the teacher cadet class last year She says that because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Beth Marchand</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX> 11th grader also says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> inspired her to go into education She taught us more in Western Civilization than I ve ever learned in other classes says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelli Green</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX> senior In the classroom students say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college bowl type competitions On weekends she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom She just never gave it up says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Marchand Mary Beth</ENAMEX> s mother You d see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game Some fellow teachers however viewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> as cocky and too yielding to students <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander Pressures began to build Friends told her she was pushing too hard Because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> s extra work was also helping her earn points in the state s incentive bonus program But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of 5 000 in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of 23 000 Winning a bonus for a third year wasn t that important to her Mrs Yeargin insists But others at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenville High</ENAMEX> say she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Elizabeth Ariail</ENAMEX> another social studies teacher says she believed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that wouldn t demand good hearing Indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program Last March after attending a teaching seminar in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> says she returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX> two days before annual testing feeling that she hadn t prepared her low ability geography students adequately When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students Mrs Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions The rest were history sociology finance subjects they never had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> says that she also wanted to help lift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> s overall test scores usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers Mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to self esteem that her low ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test These kids broke my heart she says A whole day goes by and no one even knows they re alive They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them who loved them The last thing they needed was another drag down blow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX> officials and prosecutors say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> is lying They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case wasn t tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Watson</ENAMEX> the prosecutor in the case who is also president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> s alumni association <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding I wanted to help all students <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Watson</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair Do I have much sympathy for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Watson</ENAMEX> asks Not really I believe in the system I believe you have to use the system to change it What she did was like taking the law into your own hands <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the morale damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring She says she offered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate Mrs Yeargin declined She said something like You just want to make it easy for the school I was dumbfounded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> recalls It was like someone had turned a knife in me To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> won widespread local support The school board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf Supportive callers decried unfair testing not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> on a local radio talk show on which she appeared The show didn t give the particulars of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> s offense saying only that she helped students do better on the test The message to the board of education out of all this is we ve got to take a serious look at how we re doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state said the talk show host Editorials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX> newspaper allowed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being overused The radio show enraged us says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward Partly</ENAMEX> because of the show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Watson</ENAMEX> says the district decided not to recommend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> for a first time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case Over 50 witnesses mostly students were interviewed At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenville High School</ENAMEX> meanwhile some students especially on the cheerleading squad were crushed It s hard to explain to a 17 year old why someone they like had to go says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward Soon T</ENAMEX> shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school s familiar red and white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GHS</ENAMEX> logo on the front On the back the shirts read We have all the answers Many colleagues are angry at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> She did a lot of harm says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathryn Rice</ENAMEX> who had discovered the crib notes We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gayle Key</ENAMEX> a mathematics teacher The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms There may be others doing what she did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement and because she was afraid of further charges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> for one was relieved Despite the strong evidence against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Yeargin</ENAMEX> popular sentiment was so strong in her favor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Ward</ENAMEX> says that I m afraid a jury wouldn t have convicted herSince chalk first touched slate schoolchildren have wanted to know What s on the test These days students can often find the answer in test coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests The mathematics section of the widely used <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Achievement Test</ENAMEX> asks fifth graders What is another name for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> numeral IX It also asks them to add two sevenths and three sevenths Worksheets in a test practice kit called Learning Materials sold to schools across the country by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan Mcgraw Hill School Publishing Co</ENAMEX> contain the same questions In many other instances there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials What s more the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan Mcgraw Hill</ENAMEX> a joint venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgraw Hill Inc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX> s parent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell Communication Corp Close</ENAMEX> parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say Test preparation booklets software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school sponsored cheating If I took these preparation booklets into my classroom I d have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it wasn t cheating says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kaminski</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traverse City Mich</ENAMEX> teacher who has studied test coaching He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress It s as if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class and when everybody aces the test they say their kids are good in European history says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cannell</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albuquerque N M</ENAMEX> psychiatrist and founder of an

test to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth grade CAT Because many of these subskills the symmetry of geometrical figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar graphs for example are only a small part of the total fifth grade curriculum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kaminski</ENAMEX> says the preparation kits wouldn t replicate too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures But Learning Materials matched on 66 5 of 69 subskills Scoring High matched on 64 5 In CAT sections where students knowledge of two letter consonant sounds is tested the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know Learning Materials for the fifth grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Brownell</ENAMEX> senior editor of Scoring High says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs Kaminski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehrens</ENAMEX> are ignoring the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format He said authors of Scoring High scrupulously avoid replicating exact questions but he doesn t deny that some items are similar When Scoring High first came out in 1979 it was a publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Mcgraw Hill</ENAMEX> was outraged In a 1985 advisory to educators <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcgraw Hill</ENAMEX> said Scoring High shouldn t be used because it represented a parallel form of the CAT and CTBS tests But in 1988 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcgraw Hill</ENAMEX> purchased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX> unit that publishes Scoring High which later became part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan Messrs Brownell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX> say they are unaware of any efforts by <ENAMEX

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal tissue transplants Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer s Parkinson s and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntington</ENAMEX> s But anti abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mason</ENAMEX> assistant secretary for health said the ban on federal funding of fetal tissue transplant research should be continued indefinitely He said the ban won t stop privately funded tissue transplant research or federally funded fetal tissue research that doesn t involve transplants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> officials say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX> will support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Mason</ENAMEX> s ruling which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> Institutes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Health Both Dr Mason</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Sullivan</ENAMEX> oppose federal funding for abortion as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> except in cases where a woman s life is threatened The controversy began in 1987 when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> Institutes of Health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson s disease The department placed a moratorium on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues A majority of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding The dispute has hampered the administration s efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> and the Centers for Disease Control Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal tissue transplants <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Novello</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> nominated to serve as surgeon general reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Novello</ENAMEX> is deputy director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute</ENAMEX> of Child Health and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Development</ENAMEX> Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts Earlier this week <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Sullivan</ENAMEX> tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> will be judged by standards of scientific and administrative excellence not politics But the administration s handling of the fetal tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Genel</ENAMEX> associate dean of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale Medical School</ENAMEX> The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized so that no mechanism exists for finding a middle ground <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal tissue transplants But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Genel</ENAMEX> warns that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Mason</ENAMEX> s ruling may discourage private funding The unavailability of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly don t provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said Despite the flap over transplants federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer or to regulate genes that cause Down s syndrome the leading cause of mental retardation according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> summary The <ENAMEX

report detailed information about clients who pay them more than 10 000 in cash The warnings issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim the information is protected by attorney client privilege The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than 10 000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions in the course of trade or business to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 The form asks for such details as the client s name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> number passport number and details about the services provided for the payment Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison Attorneys have argued since 1985 when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who don t wish their identities to be known Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> in recent years citing attorney client privilege Until last week the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> rarely acted on the incomplete forms This form forces a lawyer to become in effect a witness against his client said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal R Sonnett</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX> of

domestic bank accounts These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sonnett</ENAMEX> said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals wouldn t want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the <ENAMEX

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Lefcourt</ENAMEX> to deal with the matter The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Delegates

review and advance notice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ross</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> officials opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> s moderate

TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> told attorneys that failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated In some cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> confirmed that there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now Individuals familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> s

continuing industry wide slowdown in semiconductor demand In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> the custom chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated 2 million to 3 million net loss for the third quarter But company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a 43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world wide manufacturing operations citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques Over the summer months there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector our primary market said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilfred J Corrigan</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer In addition recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment at least until midyear As a result the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and make appropriate reductions in operating expenses The 35 7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share Not counting the extraordinary charge the company said it would have had a net loss of 3 1 million or seven cents a share A year earlier it had profit of 7 5 million or 18 cents a share Revenue rose 42 to 133 7 million from 94 million The charge partly reflects a switch from older five inch to more efficient six inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips Related to that decision the company said it was converting its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Clara Calif</ENAMEX> factory to a research and development facility A spokesman declined to speculate about

persistent Japanese demand for U S bond issues While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U S economic indicators dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U S currency from plunging below key levels against the mark At the same time dealers said the U S unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark s strength resulting in a stalemate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Goldinger</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Insight Inc</ENAMEX> reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well the mark climbed to 77 70 yen from 77 56 yen late Tuesday in <ENAMEX

say that the prospect of lower U S interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high yield <ENAMEX

slowing U S economy and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> than U S economic indicators Dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U S purchasing managers report The managers index which measures the health of the manufacturing sector stood at 47 6 in October above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> s 46 and also above average forecasts for the index of 45 3 Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants

this era of frantic competition for ad dollars a lot of revenue desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space So

supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> s good guys and bad boys In one feature called In the Dumpster editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender From an advertising standpoint the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days With only two issues under its belt Garbage has alienated some would be advertisers and raised the ire of others <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> for one is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere In the Dumpster column The magazine s editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging s polystyrene foam polyproplene and polyester film all plastic items they say are non biodegradable It s precisely the kind of product that s created the municipal landfill monster the editors wrote I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage but it is practicing journalistic garbage fumes a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> wasn t even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed he says making it less an offender than was portrayed He admits though it isn t one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> s better products in terms of recyclability <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup</ENAMEX> not surprisingly doesn t have any plans to advertise in the magazine according to its spokesman Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madison Avenue</ENAMEX> s big spenders You

senior vice president and media director at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DDB Needham Chicago</ENAMEX> The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base of big time ad spenders he adds The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors</ENAMEX> but the majority were from companies like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waste Management Inc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bumkins International</ENAMEX> firms that don t spend

to extend car safety requirements to light trucks and vans which now account for almost one third of all vehicle sales in the U S They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars They didn t have much luck during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration But now

TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX> announced a 75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked This is the peak of my wine making experience <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Winiarski</ENAMEX> declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and I wanted to single it out as such It is in my estimation the best wine Stag s Leap has produced and with fewer than 700 cases available it is sure to sell quickly The price is a new high for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Cabernet Sauvignon</ENAMEX> but it is not the highest Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of 100 a bottle One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums wines limited in production of exceptional quality or so perceived at any rate and with exceedingly high prices For years this group included a stable of classics <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> first growths <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lafite Rothschild Latour Haut Brion Petrus Grand Cru Burgundies Romanee Conti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Tache</ENAMEX> deluxe Champagnes Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal rarefied sweet wines Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and Biondi Santi Brunello Riserva from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuscany</ENAMEX> These first magnitude wines ranged in price from 40 to 125 a bottle In the last year or so however this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition and it almost seems that there s a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle among current releases from every major wine region on the globe <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> can boast the lion s share of high priced bottles <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> s first growths from 1985 and 1986 are 60 to 80 each except for the smallest in terms of production Chateau Petrus which costs around 250 These prices seem rather modest however in light of other French wines from current vintages Chateau Yquem the leading Sauternes now goes for well over 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 the spectacularly rich 1983 runs 179 In Champagne some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward 100 a bottle The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs The 82 82 Salon is 115 Roederer Cristal at 90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger s Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level The great reds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhone Valley</ENAMEX> have soared in price as well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E Guigal</ENAMEX> s 1982 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cote Rotie La Landonne</ENAMEX> for example is 120 None of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> s wine regions can steal a march on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burgundy</ENAMEX> however The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee Conti 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world have commanded three digit price tags for several years now With the 1985 vintage they soared higher <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Tache</ENAMEX> 195 Richebourg 180 Romanee Conti 225 Another small <ENAMEX

Shapiro</ENAMEX> of Marty s one of the largest wine shops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> What s different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out We re seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Shapiro</ENAMEX> continued We ve seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the 40s and 50s which go for 300 to 400 a bottle Some of the newer wines even at 90 to 100 a bottle or so almost offer a bargain Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond Creek</ENAMEX> It s made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly the last was 1979 and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owner Al Brownstein</ENAMEX> originally planned to sell it for 60 a bottle but when a retailer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX> asked Is that wholesale or retail he re thought the matter Offering the wine at roughly 65 a bottle wholesale 100 retail he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers 1 no the wine is too high 2 responses 2 yes it s high but I ll take it 2 responses 3 I ll take all I can get 58 responses The wine was shipped in six bottle cases instead of the usual 12 but even at that it was spread thin going to 62 retailers in 28 states We thought it was awfully expensive said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sterling Pratt</ENAMEX> wine director at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schaefer</ENAMEX> s in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skokie Ill</ENAMEX> one of the top stores in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> but there are people out there with very different opinions of value We got our two six packs and they re gone <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pratt</ENAMEX> remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers don t like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on Even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move There may be sticker shock reaction initially said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pratt</ENAMEX> but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide it s worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection It s just sort of a one upsmanship thing with some people added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Shapiro</ENAMEX> They like to talk about having the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Rock Terrace</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond Creek</ENAMEX> s Cabernets or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet or the Petrus Producers have seen this market opening up and they re now creating wines that appeal to these people That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago They won t buy if the quality is not there said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cedric Martin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Wine Cellar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX> Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Martin</ENAMEX> has increased prices on some wines like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grgich Hills Chardonnay</ENAMEX> now 32 just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the 30 to 40 range Image has of course a great deal to do with what sells and what doesn t and it can t be forced Wine merchants can t keep Roederer Cristal in stock but they have to push Salon le Mesnil even lowering the price from 115 to 90 It s hardly a question of quality the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine but as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pratt</ENAMEX> noted people have their own ideas about value It s interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines aren t always walking out the door In every major market in the U S for instance you can buy 86 86 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Tache</ENAMEX> or Richebourg virtually all of the first growth <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> except Petrus as well as Opus One and Dominus from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> and at the moment the Stag s Leap 1985 Cask 23 With the biggest wine buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare By <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> it should be fairly clear what s

TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to cut short term interest rates but it isn t clear whether the central bank will do so A survey by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks while upward pressures on prices have moderated The economy is clearly slowing says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Black</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey Nevertheless</ENAMEX> both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guffey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Black</ENAMEX> say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern We re coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guffey Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials are looking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to bring down rates and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit

and material handling equipment Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts particularly for discretionary big ticket items such as furniture home appliances and consumer electronics And

performance and doesn t see a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession There is always a chance of recession added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guffey</ENAMEX> but if you ask me to put

vitally important for those Japanese business interests in the U S to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people said the spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taizo Watanabe</ENAMEX> At the same time though he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries notably <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> are acquiring more American assets Fears that Japanese investors are buying up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> have escalated sharply in the past several weeks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp</ENAMEX> s purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca Cola Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Estate Co</ENAMEX> s acquisition of a 51 holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> the owner of some of midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> s most exclusive real estate Even before those moves added fuel the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> of one U S investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T Boone Pickens Jr</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> oilman has acquired a 26 2 stake valued at more than 1 2 billion in an automotive lighting company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito Manufacturing Co</ENAMEX> But he has failed to gain any influence at the company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> has refused to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pickens</ENAMEX> seats on its board asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> s other shareholders into buying him out at a profit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pickens</ENAMEX> made considerable political hay with his troubles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> chaired by a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texan Democratic Sen Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> last month urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S Trade Representative Carla Hills</ENAMEX> to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pickens</ENAMEX> s experience in talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dallara</ENAMEX> and Japanese officials say the question of investors access to the U S and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public s attention a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week s talks Among them are differences in savings and investment rates corporate structures and management and government spending Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other The U S says it is anxious for results We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we ve identified and we need it by next spring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dallara</ENAMEX> says Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed But they haven t clarified what those might be After the first set of meetings two months ago some U S officials complained that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> hadn t come up with specific changes it was prepared to make The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions Just to say the distribution system is wrong doesn t mean anything says a Ministry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Trade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry</ENAMEX> official We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time the Japanese say no matter how badly the U S wants quick results For instance at the first meeting the two sides couldn t even agree on basic data used in price discussions Since then a team of about 15 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Commerce Department</ENAMEX> officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices By Monday they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust Little by little there is progress says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITI</ENAMEX> official Both sides are taking action

are rapidly increasing their stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> s smaller business For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> the controversial trend improves access to <ENAMEX

TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candela</ENAMEX> turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui Co</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s largest trading companies for investment In a joint

Ministry of Health import approval for two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candela</ENAMEX> laser products one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions At last count <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candela</ENAMEX> had sold 4 million of its medical devices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> The deal also gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> access to a high

vice president Indeed for many Japanese trading companies the favorite U S small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use The Japanese companies bankroll many small U S companies with promising products or ideas frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks won t touch Japanese companies have financed small and medium sized U S firms for years but in recent months the pace has taken off In the first half of 1989 alone Japanese corporations invested 214 million in minority positions in U S companies a 61 rise from the figure for all of 1987 reports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture Economics Inc</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Needham Mass</ENAMEX> concern tracks investments in new businesses In addition of course some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U S firms Heightened Japanese interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large highly visible U S corporations such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> Pictures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> Only this week it was announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Estate Co</ENAMEX> had acquired a 51 stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> s prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> While the small deals are far less conspicuous they add to Japanese penetration of the U S

deposit or qualify for a 10 000 personal line of credit I deserve something for my loyalty she says She took her business to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Atlanta</ENAMEX> So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days For nearly a decade banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services But many banks are turning away from strict price competition Instead they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population You re dead in the water if you aren t segmenting the market says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Moore</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synergistics Research Corp</ENAMEX> a bank consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta NCNB Corp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte N

cash NN flow statement to help in saving money In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September Union Planters Corp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis Tenn</ENAMEX> launched The Edge account a package designed for the thirtysomething crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans The theory Such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years For some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the demographic segment with the highest savings Those efforts are being stepped up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judie Macdonald</ENAMEX> vice president of retail sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barnett Banks Inc</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jacksonville Fla</ENAMEX> says the company now targets sub segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles Varying age geography and life style differences create numerous sub markets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Macdonald</ENAMEX> says She says individual <ENAMEX

year old in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boca Raton</ENAMEX> may care more about Senior Olympic games while a 75 year old in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama City</ENAMEX> may care more about a seminar on health she says Banks have tried packaging before In 1973 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo Co</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold Account</ENAMEX> which included free checking a credit card safe deposit box and travelers checks for a 3 monthly fee The concept begot a slew of copycats but the banks stopped promoting the packages One big reason thin margins Many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to computerize and couldn t target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable As banks earnings were squeezed in the mid 1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as high rate Cds Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account it began offering money market accounts certificates of deposit and interest bearing checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Banking Corp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> extend their market share battles into small towns across the nation Today a banker is worrying about local regional and money center banks as well as thrifts and credit unions says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Moore</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synergistics Research So</ENAMEX> people who weren t even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael P Sullivan</ENAMEX> who runs his own bank consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte N C</ENAMEX> This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today s rate sensitive customers costly Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place For their troubles the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate The more accounts customers have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sullivan</ENAMEX> says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it That can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to savers investors Packaging has some drawbacks The additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> spent more than 50 million to introduce its Chemplus line several packages aimed at different segments in 1986 according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jacob</ENAMEX> senior vice president of marketing It s not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Jacob</ENAMEX> says Still bankers expect packaging to flourish primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs These days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Moore</ENAMEX> says Some banks are already moving in that direction according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alvin T Sale</ENAMEX> marketing director at <ENAMEX

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> halts of program trading during market emergencies But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> chairman said he doesn t support reinstating a collar on program trading arguing that firms could get around such a limit The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Merc</ENAMEX> said a new one hour price limit would take effect in its Standard Poor s 500 stock index futures pit once S P 500 futures fell 20 index points the equivalent of about a 150 point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> If the 20 point limit is triggered after 1 30 p m <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3 15 p m With the limit in effect members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices but not below it The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock index futures on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday Oct</ENAMEX> 13 when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials plunged 190 points and stock index futures prices skidded as well Late that afternoon the S P 500 stock index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points hitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> said that its existing 30 minute 12 point limit on S P 500 stock index futures trading equal to about 100 points on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials which was triggered Oct 13 will remain in effect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leo Melamed Merc</ENAMEX> executive committee chairman said that the 12 point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct 13 But when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30 point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock index futures prices synchronized Several traders maintained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> s 12 point circuit breaker aggravated the market slide Oct 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Stock Exchange All</ENAMEX> of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly The exchange also said that the 30 point circuit breaker which currently provides only a one hour respite during market sell offs will become the maximum one day limit for the S P 500 stock index futures contract the one day limit now is 50 index points A final modification was made to the five point opening limit for the contract The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> said that five point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading The limit lapses under current

exercise the English invented 380 years ago requires physical dexterity some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration Proper English bells are started off in rounds from the highest pitched bell to the lowest a simple descending scale using in larger churches as many as 12 bells Then at a signal the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking Each variation or change can occur only once the rules state Ringers memorize patterns of changes known as methods which have odd sounding names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Treble Bob Major</ENAMEX> or Grandsire Caters A series of 5 000 or so changes is a peal and takes about three hours A look at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> night practice at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Mary Abbot</ENAMEX> church in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kensington</ENAMEX> district of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> gives an idea of the work involved Ten shirt sleeved ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a prize fighter s stance each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber No one speaks and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves muffled by the ceiling Totally absorbed the ringers stare straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it rope sight to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls Far above in the belfry the huge bronze bells mounted on wheels swing madly through a full 360 degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the inverted or mouth up position Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change In a well known detective story involving church bells English novelist Dorothy L Sayers described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection Ringers she added are filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed Ringing does become a bit of an obsession admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephanie Pattenden</ENAMEX> master of the band at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Mary Abbot</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> s best female ringers It is a passion that usually stays in the tower however More often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry When their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often skip off to the local pub leaving worship for others below This does not sit well with some clerics With membership of the Church of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> steadily dwindling strong willed vicars are pressing equally strong willed and often non religious ringers to attend services Two years ago the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rev Jeremy Hummerstone</ENAMEX> vicar of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Torrington Devon</ENAMEX> got so fed up with ringers who didn t attend service he sacked the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest They were a self perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vicar Hummerstone</ENAMEX> says An entirely new band rings today at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Torrington</ENAMEX> several of whom are members of the congregation But there still aren t enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells At St Mary s Church in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ilminster Somerset</ENAMEX> the bells have fallen silent following a dust up over church attendance The vicar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W D Jones</ENAMEX> refuses to talk about it saying it would reopen the wound But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C J B Marshall</ENAMEX> vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar So crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicar Marshall</ENAMEX> admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active bell ringer himself The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Council</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church Bell Ringers</ENAMEX> a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with vicars says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C Baldwin</ENAMEX> president It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled The Bells in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Your Care Says Mr Baldwin</ENAMEX> We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baldwin</ENAMEX> is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers One survey says that of the 100 000 trained bellringers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> today only 40 000 of them still ring Also ringers don t always live where the bells need to be rung like in small rural parishes and inner city churches But the council s program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baldwin Right</ENAMEX> now we re lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 he adds One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male dominated field more than a third of the ringers today are women They aren t accepted everywhere however The oldest bell ringing group in the country the Ancient Society of College Youths founded in 1637 remains male only a fact that s particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s most prestigious churches <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Paul</ENAMEX> s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey This being <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> no woman has filed an equal opportunity suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to The Ringing World a weekly newspaper for ringers One writer signing his letter as Red blooded balanced male remarked on the frequency of women fainting in peals and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings In the torrent of replies that followed one woman ringer from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Solihull</ENAMEX> observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired badly dressed decorated with acne and a large beer belly frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals Another women wrote from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheffield</ENAMEX> to say that in her 60 years of ringing I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry I have seen one or two men die bless themInvestors unsettled by the stock market s gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10 But don t breathe too easy Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn In the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock market party was almost over That can be a trap for unwary investors says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bernstein</ENAMEX> senior quantitative analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Co Strong</ENAMEX> dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Boesel</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T Rowe Price Growth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Income Fund</ENAMEX> explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time Invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments he says And recessionary environments aren t hospitable to the stock market Indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks In 1976 for example dividends on the stocks in Standard Poor s 500 stock index soared 10 following much slower growth the year before The S P index started sliding in price in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> 1976 and fell 12 in 1977 despite a 15 expansion in dividends that year That pattern hasn t always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious Payouts on the S P 500 stocks rose 10 in 1988 according to Standard Poor s Corp and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 and 14 Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double digit gains continuing Meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag While dividends have risen smartly their expansion hasn t kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices As a result the market s dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards Put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S P 500 The figure is currently about 3 3 up from 3 2 before the recent market slide Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3 A drop below that 3 benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boesel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T Rowe Price</ENAMEX> In fact the market has always tanked Always There s never been an exception says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald W Perritt</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock market data The last time the S P 500 yield dropped below 3 was in the summer of 1987 Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle There have been only seven other times in 1929 1933 1961 1965 1968 1971 and 1972 when the yield on the S P 500 dropped below 3 for at least two consecutive months <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Perritt</ENAMEX> found And in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year Still some market analysts say the current 3 3 reading isn t as troublesome as it might have been in years past It s not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H Coxon</ENAMEX> head of stock investments for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> based insurer In particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Coxon</ENAMEX> says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically So while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength Rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven G Einhorn</ENAMEX> co chairman of the investment policy committee at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs Co</ENAMEX> He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3 6 That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so he says What will happen to dividend growth next year Common wisdom suggests a single digit rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc</ENAMEX> for instance is forecasting growth in S P 500 dividends of just under 5 in 1990 down from an estimated 11 this year In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns the environment the firm expects in 1990 the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 to a decline of 1 according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Doerflinger</ENAMEX> The minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken Dividend growth on the order of 12 is expected by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Coxon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Einhorn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard Poor s of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October basically unchanged from 138 a year ago S P said Wednesday That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year earlier pace While the S P tally doesn t measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year In any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double digit levels <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Einhorn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 to 15 total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months vs a cash rate of return of perhaps 7 or 8 if dividend growth is weak But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boesel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T Rowe Price</ENAMEX> who also expects 12 growth in dividends next year doesn t think it will help the overall market all that much Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but I don t think it s a main consideration he says With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year I wouldn t look for the market to have much upside from current levelsYour

emigrate to foreign stock markets But in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> where computer driven trading now plays a small but growing role traders say a number of hurdles loom Government officials especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U S furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is very concerned about the possible effects of program trading a senior Japanese official said after the Oct 13 stock plunge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York U S</ENAMEX> stock index futures aren t even traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> now And because of the time difference the Japanese and the U S markets trading hours don t overlap It all adds up to a barrier to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> style index arbitrage the most popular form of U S program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and the price of a futures contract in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> based on those stocks About 11 6 of all program trading by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> firms in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> took place in foreign markets according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> data Yet it is difficult to imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> racing to introduce <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> style stock index futures <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> already is scrutinizing institutional investors activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makato Utsumi</ENAMEX> vice minister for international finance Program trading has taken off in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> since last year s introduction of home market stock index futures trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Osaka</ENAMEX> stock exchanges But regulators are wary They haven t forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec 7 when the first bout of foreign led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half hour of trading startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time Maybe it wasn t enough a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> official noted after the Dec 7 surge <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> s regulators have since tightened controls on index related stock purchases <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> s leading program traders are the big U S securities houses though the Japanese are playing catch up Some U S firms notably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Group Inc</ENAMEX> have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage both for customers and for their own accounts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> last week joined a growing list of U S securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deryck C Maughan</ENAMEX> who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John S Wadsworth</ENAMEX> who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> there ascribe a good part of their firms success in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to their ability to offer sophisticated futures related investment strategies to big institutional clients They don t have plans to cut back It has not been disruptive in the markets here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Maughan</ENAMEX> said The real difference seems to be that the cash market here is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market isn t having the same impact it does in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British</ENAMEX> also are scrutinizing program trades Index arbitrage trading is something we want to watch closely an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> said We don t think there is cause for concern at the moment <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U S stocks Market professionals said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> has several attractions First the trading is done over the counter and isn t reported on either the U S or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stock trading tapes Second it can be used to unwind positions before U S trading begins but at prices pegged to the previous session s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> close In addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties don t have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist s fee Still Much less index arbitrage activity is done over here than in the U S said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Barfield</ENAMEX> chief investment manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Life Assurance Co</ENAMEX> which manages about 15 billion 23 72 billion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> institutional funds <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> has two main index arbitrage instruments A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 100 share index option contract is traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> s Traded Options Market And an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT SE</ENAMEX> futures contract is traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London International Financial</ENAMEX> Futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Both</ENAMEX> contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash The average number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT SE</ENAMEX> option contracts traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract s launch in 1984 This year the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9 118 up from 4 645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984 But a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index options trading was only 15 of the size of the underlying equity market exchange officials said This compares with estimates that the U S derivatives market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic marketThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981 casting a solid 382 37 vote for a compromise measure backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor Advocates said the 90 cent an hour rise to 4 25 an hour by April 1991 is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> and Democratic leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> after congressional Republicans urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise So both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four year law was enacted in 1977 raising the wage to 3 35 an hour from 2 65 Under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to 3 80 next April The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it There are no smiles about this bill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep Pat Williams D Mont</ENAMEX> said during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> floor debate yesterday But because it s all we ve got I m going to vote for it While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U S manufacturing wage the level of 4 25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 of average factory pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Williams</ENAMEX> said But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rep Marge Roukema R N J</ENAMEX> instead praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> s acceptance of a new youth training wage a subminimum that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> administrations have sought for many years Adopting a training wage policy means getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Roukema</ENAMEX> said Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> unions and Democrats long fought the idea but recently acceded to it in the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration insistence The compromise sets the training wage at 3 35 an hour next April and at 3 61 an hour or 85 of the minimum wage in April 1991 Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another 90 days if the company uses a government certified training program for the young workers The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> previously insisted on an unrestricted six month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job The U S Chamber of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> still opposed to any mininum wage increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for
