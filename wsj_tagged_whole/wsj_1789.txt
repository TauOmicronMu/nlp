Sebastian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> took over the oil workers union <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> s most powerful labor organization only last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> But even in that short time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaquin Hernandez Galicia</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina President Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> used the army to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX> who reigned for 28 years over a graft riddled empire that made state run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petroleos Mexicanos</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> one of the world s most inefficient oil companies Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> is facing accusations that he s as much a company man as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX> was a crook In recent contract negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> management <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union s role in subcontracting long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings And with the quiet pragmatism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> replacing the prickly populism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX> government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> s new order hasn t arrived without resistance Brawls between union factions still erupt at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> installations Leftist leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuauhtemoc Cardenas</ENAMEX> publicly questioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> s moral quality suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country s oil a symbol of Mexican nationalism to foreigners The 61 year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> takes such criticisms in stride This isn t a new kind of union leadership it s a new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> We re no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> which produces 40 of government revenue desperately needs new investment Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982 the government has siphoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> s coffers to make payments on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> s 97 billion foreign debt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little</ENAMEX> money has been returned to upgrade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> s aging facilities While the government drains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> from above the union has drained it from below A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> s operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each 1 in sales far above the industry norm The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> has been importing gasoline this year Some projections show <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> importing crude by the end of the century barring an overhaul of operations Whatever you tried to change whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners the big obstacle was the old union leadership says oil consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Baker Enter Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro enterprise regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Salinas</ENAMEX> I m the secretary general if there is one he says greeting a visitor to his office Beginning as a laborer in a refinery <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> put in more than 40 years at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> before being pushed into retirement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX> after a dispute two years ago Though he also long benefited from the system built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Quina Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> says union perks had simply gotten out of hand They are at the base of all of the problems of corruption he says Thus in recent contract negotiations <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> gave up the union s right to assign 40 of all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> s outside contracts an enormous source of kickbacks The union also ceded the 2 commission it had received on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> maintenance contracts The union will keep a 2 commission on construction projects The new contract also eliminates the 15 monthly coupon good only at union owned grocery stores that was part of the salary of every worker from roughneck to chief executive About 9 800 technical workers notably chemists and lawyers were switched to non union status Also because of its reduced capital budget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> has phased out about 50 000 transitory construction workers reducing the work force to about 140 000 the union leader says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> says the union s sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22 increase in compensation But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract We are retaking the instruments of administration says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raul Robles</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> subdirector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> officials wouldn t say how much money the new contract would save the company but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around 500 million a year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> s customers also are pleased with the company s new spirit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grupo Desc</ENAMEX> a big conglomerate has long depended on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material But when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> plant shut down for an annual overhaul it would never give notice to its customers The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ernesto Vega Velasco Desc</ENAMEX> s finance director This year for the first time <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desc</ENAMEX> and other customers were consulted well in advance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> plant s shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years In May the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners long limited to a 40 stake in secondary petrochemical companies to own up to 100 Later the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> s courtship with private companies and especially foreign ones is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 They are preparing the workers for what s coming foreign control wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heberto Castillo</ENAMEX> a leftist leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products But the new union leader makes no apologies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> s more outward looking attitude If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence sooner or later we re going to become victims of our own isolation he says
