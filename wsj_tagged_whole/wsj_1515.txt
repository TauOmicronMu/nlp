When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rune Andersson</ENAMEX> set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg AB</ENAMEX> in the early 1980s he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology electronics or biotechnology and get out of mature basic industries <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> recalls Yet under its 45 year old president <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division later adding mining as well as building and construction materials It was a gutsy move for a little known executive fired after only two months as president of his previous company But going against the grain has never bothered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview the diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Swede</ENAMEX> quips It turned out to be lucky for us If the whole market thinks what you re doing is crazy you don t have much competition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> is anxious to strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s balance sheet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Characteristically</ENAMEX> he didn t waste much time getting started On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuesday Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions minerals processing and building and distribution as separately quoted companies on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm s Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> At current market prices the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2 5 billion Swedish kronor 386 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s coffers analysts say The board had also been expected to approve a Skr1 5 billion international offering of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> shares But that share issue intended to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> better known among international investors was postponed until market conditions stabilize people familiar with the situation say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s internationally traded Bfree series stock plunged Skr29 4 48 to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skr205</ENAMEX> 31 65 in volatile trading Monday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm Tuesday</ENAMEX> the shares regained <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skr20</ENAMEX> closing at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skr225 Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the conglomerate stigma that has held down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s share price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 of both units The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent A family foundation set up by late founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Dunker</ENAMEX> controls 59 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s voting shares outstanding But the foundation bylaws require the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation s holding That growth is the result of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> s shopping spree during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years Most of the new additions were barely profitable if not outright loss makers Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AB Electrolux Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood and got quick results The treatment turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> s biggest and fastest growing industrial concerns Between 1985 and 1988 sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold Many analysts expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> who owns 1 7 of the company to be named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s new chairman when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernst Herslow</ENAMEX> steps down next year But the promotion isn t likely to alter a management style <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> describes as being the driving force leading the troops not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas Last month in his boldest move yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> joined forces with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noranda Inc</ENAMEX> in a joint 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falconbridge Ltd Industry</ENAMEX> analysts suggest that the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> could vault <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world class mining concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> isn t in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anglo American Corp</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Kurtanjek</ENAMEX> a mining analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">James Capel Co London</ENAMEX> But we certainly like what we ve seen so far But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> still must clear some tough hurdles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> acknowledges that the company s mining division will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion Booming metals prices have fueled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s recent profit surge raising mining s share of pretax profit to 68 this year from a big loss two years earlier But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mining</ENAMEX> is likely to remain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s main business Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> manages to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> venture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> each came close to winning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> alone before the successful joint bid Some analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> would prefer to break up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedes</ENAMEX> relatively inexperienced in international mining operations could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> operating on its home turf <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> insists that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noranda</ENAMEX> haven t discussed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> break up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> he says will continue operating in its current form We d be reluctant to accept 50 50 ownership in a manufacturing company But such partnerships are common in mining where there aren t problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> s president says Perhaps more important both companies share <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> s belief in the coming renaissance of base industries If the 1980s were a decade of consumption the 90s will be the investment decade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Andersson</ENAMEX> says The whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment he says That s beginning to change And investment is the key word for base metals and most other businesses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> is in
