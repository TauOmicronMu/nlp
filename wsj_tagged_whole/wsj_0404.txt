<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe Inc</ENAMEX> a biotechnology concern said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai Pharmaceutical Co</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> for about 110 million or almost double the market price of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> s stock The move is sure to heighten concerns about increased Japanese investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> biotechnology firms It is also likely to bolster fears that the Japanese will use their foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> an industry leader in the field of genetic probes which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests last year signed an agreement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> to exclusively market its diagnostic products in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> for infectious diseases and cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs That arrangement apparently has worked well and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas A Bologna</ENAMEX> president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> founded in 1983 said the sale of the company means we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> agreed to pay 6 25 a share for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> s 17 6 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis Yesterday in national trading in the over the counter market <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> common closed at 3 25 a share Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> leads in most areas of biotechnology largely because of research investment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> government the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> know how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Godown</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Biotechnology Association</ENAMEX> He added that until now the Japanese have only acquired equity positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> biotechnology companies They are piggybacking onto developed technology he said During the past five years Japanese concerns have invested in several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> s 431 independent biotechnology companies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> has been one of the most active Japanese players in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> biotechnology companies it has an equity investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Genetics Institute Inc Cambridge Mass</ENAMEX> and a joint venture agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn Co Kalamazoo Mich</ENAMEX> The Japanese government <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Godown</ENAMEX> said has stated that it wants 10 to 11 of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products It is becoming more of a horse race every day between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> he said adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor electronics and automobile industries Japanese companies will use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> developed technology to gain trade advantages <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bologna</ENAMEX> said the sale would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> to speed up the development of new technology and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer By 1988 when only 10 genetic probe based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the Food and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Administration</ENAMEX> eight of them had been developed and sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe Osamu Nagayama</ENAMEX> deputy president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> which spends about 15 of its sales on research and development was unable to pinpoint how much money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> would pump into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> We think <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> has technology important to people s health he said adding We think it is important for us to have such technology He and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bologna</ENAMEX> emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> which will expand significantly as a result of the acquisition In 1988 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> had net income of 60 million on revenue of 991 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genprobe</ENAMEX> had a net loss of 9 5 million on revenue of 5 8 million Recently <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> received a broad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> patent for a technology that helps detect identify and quantify non viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called ribosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">RNA</ENAMEX> Among other things <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bologna</ENAMEX> said that the sale will facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> s marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDS Chugai</ENAMEX> also will help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> with its regulatory and marketing expertise in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia Mr Bologna</ENAMEX> said The tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gen Probe</ENAMEX> s shares is expected to begin next Monday the company said
