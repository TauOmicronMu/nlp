If there s somethin strange in your neighborhood If there s something weird and it don t look good Who ya gon na call For starters some people call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorraine Warren</ENAMEX> When it comes to busting ghosts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe Conn</ENAMEX> couple are perfect demons They claim to have busted spirits poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country They say they now get three or four legitimate calls a week from people harried by haunts I firmly believe in angels devils and ghosts says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Warren</ENAMEX> whose business card identifies him as a demonologist If psychics don t work but your house still seems haunted you can call any one of a swelling band of skeptics such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Busch A</ENAMEX> professional magician and musician he heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scientific Investigation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paranormal Mr Busch</ENAMEX> says there is a scientific explanation for all haunts and he can even tell you how to encourage the spirits All you have to do is eat a big pizza and then go to bed he says You ll have weird dreams too Either way the ghostbusting business is going like gangbusters Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Elm</ENAMEX> Streets and Amityvilles I get calls nearly every day from people who have ghosts in their house says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Hyman</ENAMEX> a skeptical psychology professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> In a public opinion poll published in the October issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parents Magazine</ENAMEX> a third of those queried said they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people The movies the books the tabloids even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Reagan</ENAMEX> is boosting this stuff says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kurtz</ENAMEX> a philosophy professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX> who heads the <ENAMEX

chapters around the world The spirits of course could hardly care less whether people do or don t believe in them They don t even give a nod to human sensibilities by celebrating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Halloween</ENAMEX> For the spooks it s just another day of ectoplasmic business as usual ghostbusters say the holiday seems to occasion no unusual number of ghost reports One of the busiest ghostbusters is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Baker</ENAMEX> a 68 year old semi retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> psychology professor whose bushy gray eyebrows arch at the mere mention of a ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> says he has personally bested more than 50 haunts from aliens to poltergeists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Science Educators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skeptics</ENAMEX> Like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghostbusters Kentucky</ENAMEX> s stand ready to roll when haunts get out of hand But they don t careen around in an old Cadillac wear funny suits or blast away at slimy spirits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> drives a 1987 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghostbusting forays I ve never met a ghost that couldn t be explained away by perfectly natural means he says When a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> woman complained that a ghost was haunting her attic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> discovered a rat dragging a trap across the rafters A foul smelling demon supposedly plagued a house in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mannington Ky Mr Baker</ENAMEX> found an opening under the house that led to a fume filled coal mine When the weather cools <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> says hobos often hole up in abandoned houses <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">People</ENAMEX> see activity in there and the next thing you know you ve got a haunting he says On a recent afternoon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> and a reporter go ghost busting visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Stinnett</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lexington</ENAMEX> woman who has phoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> to report mysterious happenings in her house <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Stinnett</ENAMEX> says she never believed in ghosts before but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on a telephone flew off its stand doors slammed inexplicably and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen I was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see who was there and it was nobody she says eyes wide at the recollection <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> hears her out pokes around a bit asks a few questions and proposes some explanations Of the self starting vacuum cleaner he says Could be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuddles Mrs Stinnett</ENAMEX> s dog The flying telephone You tangle the base cord around a chair leg and the receiver does seem to fly off The ghostly footsteps Interstate 64 is a block away and heavy traffic can sure set a house to vibrating I m not sure he s explained everything <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Stinnett</ENAMEX> says grudgingly There are some things that have gone on here that nobody can explain she says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> promises to return if the haunting continues For especially stubborn haunts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> carries a secret weapon a vial of cornstarch I tell people it s the groundup bones of saints he says I sprinkle a little around and tell the demons to leave It s reassuring and it usually works <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hyman</ENAMEX> has investigated claims of flying cats apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come up with a plausible explanation he says for every one Invariably he says eyewitnesses are untrustworthy Two years ago a Canadian reader bet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni Magazine</ENAMEX> 1 000 that it couldn t debunk the uncanny goings on in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon Vortex</ENAMEX> a former Indian burial ground in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> To viewers from a distance visitors to the spot seemed to shrink disproportionately relative to the background The magazine called in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hyman</ENAMEX> as a consultant He showed up with a carpenter s level carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent shrinkage was caused by the perspective A very striking illusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hyman</ENAMEX> says now his voice dripping with skepticism but an illusion nevertheless The Canadian wound up writing a check The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev Alphonsus Trabold</ENAMEX> a theology professor and exorcism expert at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St Bonaventure University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Olean N Y</ENAMEX> frequently is asked to exorcise unruly spirits and he often obliges On certain occasions a spirit could be earthbound and make itself known he says It happens <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Father Trabold</ENAMEX> often uses what he calls a therapeutic exorcism a few prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave If the person believes there s an evil spirit you ask it to be gone he says The suggestion itself may do the healing But sometimes more energetic attacks are required To wrestle with a demon in a house owned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Litchfield Conn</ENAMEX> woman the Warrens recently called in an exorcist the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev Robert Mckenna</ENAMEX> a dissident clergyman who hews to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> s old Latin liturgy I attend and so does a television crew from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City Mr Warren</ENAMEX> pronounces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Litchfield</ENAMEX> case your typical demonic infestation A Scottish dwarf built the small red house 110 years ago and now his demonic ghost haunts it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Warren</ENAMEX> says The owner who begs anonymity asserts that the dwarf appearing as a dark shadow has manhandled her tossing her around the living room and yanking out a hank of hair Two previous exorcisms have failed This is a very tenacious ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Warren</ENAMEX> says darkly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Father Mckenna</ENAMEX> moves through the house praying in Latin urging the demon to split Suddenly the woman begins swaying and then writhing She s being attacked by the demon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Warren</ENAMEX> stagewhispers as the priest sprinkles holy water over the squirming woman and the television camera grinds A half hour later the woman is smiling and chatting the demon seems to have gone But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Warren</ENAMEX> says the woman has psychic burns on her back from the confrontation She declines to show them This was an invisible powerful force that s almost impossible for a layman to contemplate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Warren</ENAMEX> says solemnly as the ghostbusting entourage packs up to leave This time though he says I think we got it
