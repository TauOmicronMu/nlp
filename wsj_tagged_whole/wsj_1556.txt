Price wars between the fast food giants are starting to clobber the fast food little guys the franchisees When elephants start fighting ants get killed says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Riese</ENAMEX> co owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Restaurants</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> franchisee for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pizza Hut Roy Rogers</ENAMEX> and other chains As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast food chains and their franchisees The chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12 month thing says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Harty</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma Group Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> franchisee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burger King</ENAMEX> chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Though Charisma</ENAMEX> s sales are up slightly this year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Harty</ENAMEX> says profits will be flat or lower And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Konopnicki</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Safford Ariz</ENAMEX> licensee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald s Corp</ENAMEX> who is chairman of the company s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Operators Advisory Board</ENAMEX> says some fast food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on Until recently the huge fast food industry with sales of about 60 1 billion last year kept price skirmishing to a minimum But early this year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Inc</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Inc</ENAMEX> slashed prices and stepped up promotions says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rohs</ENAMEX> an analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim Schroder Co</ENAMEX> That brought a chain reaction in the industry The situation was further aggravated early this month when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX> s set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons It also decided to go national with pizza which it has been test marketing Now two for one deals on pizza are common so are 99 cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high The discounting say fast food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency they haven t seen before The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Mack</ENAMEX> a district manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cormack Enterprises Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burger King</ENAMEX> operator in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha Neb</ENAMEX> says discounting is so prevalent that we have to serve 15 to 20 more customers to keep sales level It s almost as if you re doing extra work to give away the food he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan D Agosto</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panda</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> an operator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX> s restaurants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX> says All we re doing is keeping the customers coming but we aren t increasing sales With fast food outlets on every corner he like many doesn t think he has a choice in the price war Our customers say that they won t go into a fast food store unless they get a coupon If the battle continues much longer many fast food businesses will close or merge predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Morrissey</ENAMEX> who owns a string of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> stores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> The industry is overbuilt he says Fast food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Restaurant Association</ENAMEX> says quick service restaurant units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> rose 14 to 131 146 between 1983 and 1987 the last year for which figures are available With the market so crowded says a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX> s in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus Ohio</ENAMEX> If you re doing well you re doing well at someone else s expense Simply put there isn t enough business for every store to grow According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rohs</ENAMEX> inflation adjusted same store sales at company owned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX> s units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> have trailed year earlier levels throughout 1989 except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">August Mcdonald</ENAMEX> s has also been running negative all year the analyst says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spokesmen</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX> s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX> s criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rohs</ENAMEX> s calculations <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Greenberg</ENAMEX> executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX> s says the company doesn t compute much less disclose inflation adjusted same store sales He adds that short term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year Profit margins at company owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX> s outlets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> are holding up quite nicely says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenberg Profits</ENAMEX> of franchisees haven t been higher since the mid 1970s he adds But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenberg</ENAMEX> s sanguine outlook isn t matched by many fast food industry observers <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Smaller</ENAMEX> chains and single store operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict Big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Harty</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burger King</ENAMEX> operator in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Morrissey</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers Franchisees can t be forced to go along with a franchiser s discounting But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lew Rudnick</ENAMEX> a principal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudnick Wolfe</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> law firm with franchise industry clients He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing In any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Says Mr Riese</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> Restaurants If you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise
