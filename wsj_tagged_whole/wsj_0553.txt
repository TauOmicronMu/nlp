We re sorry to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> s departure from the British government He is a politician with the courage of true conviction as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40 But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Exchequer</ENAMEX> may be a good thing especially if it works as he no doubt intends by forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prime Minister Thatcher</ENAMEX> and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved The early omens we admit scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fleet Street</ENAMEX> reaction was captured in the Guardian headline Departure Reveals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher Poison British</ENAMEX> politicians divide into two groups of chickens those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan Walters</ENAMEX> the counterpoint of the Chancellor s difficulties who also resigned as personal adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates conservative free market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps There are the strict monetarists who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates There are the supply side globalists who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates And there are the twin deficit Keynesians who predict devaluations to balance trade flows This is a problem not only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prime Minister Thatcher</ENAMEX> but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mulford Treasury</ENAMEX> In the British case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> is the closest thing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to a supply side globalist He not only slashed marginal tax rates initially sparking fresh growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> While no doubt agreeing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> on everything else <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> is a dyed in the wool monetarist inclined to defend floating rates to the death To make matters even more confusing the earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> experience made clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s tax cuts would have profound effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s international accounts and the value of sterling They increased the after tax rate of return and made <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> a far more attractive place to invest producing sudden capital inflows By accounting definitions this had to produce a sudden trade deficit As in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M</ENAMEX> Whatever At this point the options were Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> surely advised and forget the soaring pound To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit a policy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> has repeatedly proved disastrous Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate as the Chancellor argued and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS Faced</ENAMEX> with a similar situation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Volcker</ENAMEX> let the dollar soar though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg on the face warnings of inflation But this devastated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> manufacturing sector laying the seeds of protectionism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> though not allowed to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> chose to shadow the deutsche mark He reaped inflation along with rapid growth no doubt validating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> s predictions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> s mind But more recently the pound has been falling with high inflation which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> deployed to stop it So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albion</ENAMEX> We had been soliciting opinions on it long before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one time deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> To begin with we should note that in contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> deficit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> has been running largish budget surpluses In pursuit of this mystery Keynesian adepts and twin deficit mavens need not apply We should also add <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s own explanation as we understand it Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S Britain</ENAMEX> never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages The wage stickiness which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OECD</ENAMEX> studies confirm is particularly high in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inflation</ENAMEX> is easier to spark and harder to control We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> experience <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nearby Paul Craig Roberts</ENAMEX> a distinguished supply sider with monetarist sympathies argues the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one We recall that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roberts</ENAMEX> not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling but also led the chorus saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Volcker</ENAMEX> was too tight when he let the dollar rise Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M</ENAMEX> Whatever but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity The globalists tend to think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> ran onto technical reefs In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong pound DM rate For that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency We sympathize with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> Perhaps the shock would have been less if they d fixed to another low tax deregulated supply side economy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Reynolds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polyconomics</ENAMEX> adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus Those who can shake Keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open market operation indeed it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Reynolds</ENAMEX> also notes that since British banks have no reserve requirements high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession We would add that in political terms <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s problem was failing to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser In the end neither policy was followed and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery In particular shadowing a currency is anything but fixing it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Better</ENAMEX> to have a true monetarist policy just for the experience <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">So Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> had to resign In the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> s autobiography in The American Economist a 10 000 circulation academic journal But it was the underlying situation that became intolerable What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Major</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> will do now remains to be seen They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy that is to say stagflation This can not be solved by provoking a further downturn reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation Our advice is this Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive maximizing tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do This was the version of supply side economics that in the late 1970s and early 80s worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> and world wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> today
