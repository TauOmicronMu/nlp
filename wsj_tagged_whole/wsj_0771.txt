On an office wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> intelligence committee hangs a quote from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman David Boren Don</ENAMEX> t hold your ticket til the show s over He once used that line in a closed door meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> meaning don t shrink from taking action against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega So</ENAMEX> how did a good senator like this end up approving a policy that required the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> to warn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Noriega</ENAMEX> of any coup plot against him I agree it s ridiculous says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> decides to take or rather not to take covert action <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> disclosed the policy last week by reading it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> senators perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> fiasco to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> But the broader truth is more complicated and dismaying The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> intelligence committee and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council Staff</ENAMEX> lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> could not do to oust the Panamanian thug They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> himself didn t discover the warn your enemy nuance until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> told him privately at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> last week It s ironic that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> should be in the center of this mire A former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> governor he s a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy He s a rare Democratic hawk He s the senator most like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Vandenberg</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> senator from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rayburn</ENAMEX> are heroes of mine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> says referring as well to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Rayburn</ENAMEX> the Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> speaker who cooperated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Eisenhower</ENAMEX> They allowed this country to be credible I really want to see that happen again If this were 1949 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> might even succeed But in 1989 most senators have other ideas Last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> his committee rejected a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration plan to support a coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum</ENAMEX> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt a charming notion for a great power <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine Republican William Cohen</ENAMEX> said the plan might violate the assassination ban So the administration dropped it By October when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal even the administration was agreeing little should be done <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> doesn t think all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has made mistakes In the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> in the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran Contra</ENAMEX> I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup they have to bring their lawyers he says But even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> defends congressional oversight Writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard International Review</ENAMEX> he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there s a consensus So what does consensus mean It doesn t mean unanimous he insists though he implies it means a bipartisan majority The sustainability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> foreign policy is essential he explains Why was containment so successful Because it had bipartisan support <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Abrams</ENAMEX> a veteran of intelligence committee debates doubts that even <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grenada</ENAMEX> or the Libyan raid would have taken place if consensus had been required <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rayburn</ENAMEX> were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents modern senators <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> notwithstanding are less modest The result is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action I wouldn t say it s quite a veto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> demurs But wouldn t a president who acted despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> objections be taking grave political risks He would agrees the chairman But that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> even spies a silver lining He figures the episode will help clarify any ambiguities between the committee and administration He points to a letter on his desk his second in a week from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> saying that they don t disagree More broadly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> will shock <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> out of its fear of using military power Maybe this will jolt us out of the post <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says Maybe if every senator shared the principles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Boren</ENAMEX> But it s just as plausible to argue that if even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> can get mired in this sort of mess the problem goes beyond legal interpretation Maybe the problem is a political system that won t act without an exchange of letters that insists on running foreign policy by committee that treats a president as just another guy at the table The reply of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metzenbaums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohens</ENAMEX> is that we can t abolish these oversight committees because we ve seen too many abuses of executive power But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock The lawyers are now in charge of our national security In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> interests at stake were happily minor the only people killed were foreigners hapless enough to trust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> will Americans may not be so lucky the next time
