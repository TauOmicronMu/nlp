<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Former USX Corp Chairman David M Roderick</ENAMEX> may have been lucky he retired last May As he handed over the reins to successor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles A Corry</ENAMEX> steel profits were close to a cyclical peak Though imports were troublesome they weren t running away with the market and American companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years Perhaps most important <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX> who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid was subdued He and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> were even dining out together <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Today Mr Corry</ENAMEX> presides over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> the company s deep pocketed tenacious adversary recently disclosed that he had raised his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> stake to 13 1 and he again threatened a takeover A battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago In addition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> s giant steel segment representing 34 of its 1988 sales is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low cost minimills The import quotas got only a 2 1 extension and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> is laboring under a staggering 5 8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil It s a baptism of fire for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corry</ENAMEX> says one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> executive The burning question is whether the new chief can parry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> without being pushed into unwelcome moves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> might have to dismember the company more than he wants to Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> s stock possibly at a premium or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> s pressure With his recent purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> common stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> shattered a three year old unwritten standstill agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> In 1986 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> adroitly dodged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> s first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11 4 stake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> did so by having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> redeem a series of guaranteed notes a move that in effect raised the cost of a 7 19 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX> bid by about 3 billion And he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper Over dinners at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sky Club</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Links Club</ENAMEX> restaurants the steel executive and the big investor talked steel international trade and thoroughbred horses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> who has boned up on corporate raiders by reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T Boone Pickens</ENAMEX> s autobiography had hoped the detente would continue He was shocked associates say to learn of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> s new takeover threat Both men declined to be interviewed for this article But the fiercely competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> quickly showed he s no pushover He huddled with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent Although the board believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> it adopted a poison pill defense to be swallowed if anyone amasses a 15 stake Now it s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> s move Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> into separate oil and steel companies Given the weakness of the junk bond market can he finance a buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco Inc</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> a coup that gave him enough cash to make his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> move And although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk bond markets by making it harder to arrange takeover financing has eased some of the pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> it doesn t end the takeover threat I know it s not over a sober faced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> on Oct 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe Steel Ltd USX</ENAMEX> s partner in a steel mill in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lorain Ohio</ENAMEX> In fact it s barely begun for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job He s in a vulnerable position because he hasn t established much credibility on his own says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Jacoboski</ENAMEX> a securities analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc</ENAMEX> The 57 year old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn t stand cutting up frogs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> wanted to work for a big company that could do big things But after joining the tax department of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> subsidiary 30 years ago he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46 For years he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms wearing a hat to work because everyone else did I was never a rebel he said in an earlier interview I don t think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they ve seen me pound the table or get angry Yet the unassuming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> helped chart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> s transition from Big Steel to Big Oil He served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> s front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon Oil</ENAMEX> for 5 9 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nevertheless Mr Corry</ENAMEX> once named chief executive didn t waste any time distancing himself from his former boss who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> tower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh Soon</ENAMEX> after taking over last <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">June Mr Corry</ENAMEX> rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers a move that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> hadn t made in spite of improved earnings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> also ruled that all board meetings would be held in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Findlay Ohio Marathon</ENAMEX> s home And earlier this month he announced the sale of the reserves of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Oil Gas</ENAMEX> which was acquired three years ago and hasn t posted any significant operating profits since One former executive says Nobody wanted that deal inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Roderick</ENAMEX> who was a hunting and fishing buddy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William L Hutchison</ENAMEX> chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Oil Gas</ENAMEX> The executive recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> whispering to him and others <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remember</ENAMEX> this was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> s deal What miffed many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> executives and shareholders was that the acquisition for 3 billion of stock doubled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> shares outstanding and considerably diluted them What s more the takeover occurred as natural gas prices were falling and just as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Oil Gas</ENAMEX> reported its first annual loss in 28 years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Oil Gas</ENAMEX> sale to delight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value But when the two men met in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> a day after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> disclosed the rise in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> stake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> wanted him to sell all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Oil</ENAMEX> not just its reserves of about 1 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline gas gathering and contract drilling operations That would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> its steel mills and its diversified business segment which includes among other things mineral and transportation products Some speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price The problem is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> had planned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> has long believed associates say that the company whose 1988 sales totaled 16 88 billion is worth 70 a share if broken up The stock closed yesterday at 33 625 giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> s 33 6 million shares a value of 1 13 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> advocates the sale of the company s steel operations and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> doesn t necessarily disagree Unlike his predecessor who saw steel as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> s backbone <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> tends to view it as a capital draining and labor intensive business with limited potential associates say In the past five years <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs But the short term outlook is so so It isn t surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Roderick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corry</ENAMEX> view steel so differently While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> was reared in the shadows of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> s smoking mills <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> a city nicknamed Porkapolis and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron He has never met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Williams</ENAMEX> the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Steelworkers union and isn t active in the industry s main trade group the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Iron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel Institute</ENAMEX> which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> served as chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> thought the country needed a strong U S Steel and while Chuck agreed he was more apt to say Not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says Indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> at an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and not a day longer However shedding steel would run directly counter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> s original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas Having two major products would lessen the company s vulnerability to one market s down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Roderick</ENAMEX> once said We re a two product company and boy if you can t figure out the value of those two parts you are so damn dumb that you don t belong on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> Moreover the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> may be gone for now The time has passed for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive contends About the only way that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> now can get out of steel is to dish it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> breathing down his neck however <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some steel related tax loss carryforwards That would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> essentially an oil company with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> as its core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> has benefited from higher crude oil prices and strong demand for refined products Oil has long been <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> s pet Indeed when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions arguably the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> and his directors were aboard helicopters high above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> s rich oil reserves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Sea Should USX</ENAMEX> be left with only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marathon Mr Corry</ENAMEX> might well feel pushed to scout out other energy companies However even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> executives who work closely with him aren t sure about his long term goals I don t think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says Right now the executive adds he wants to continue to focus on paying down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> s debt by selling assets One thing is certain however <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> while studying other options probably won t make a major move until he s clear about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> s intentions And then he won t panic says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J Bruce Johnston</ENAMEX> a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adler Cohen Grigsby</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh Mr Corry</ENAMEX> learned presence under fire when as vice president of corporate planning he handled what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Johnston</ENAMEX> calls don t con me negotiations that led to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> s shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction When negotiating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> played his cards close to the vest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnnie Johnson</ENAMEX> who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> in strategic planning recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates What he really wanted to know was about a particular company but you didn t know that He wanted your own unbiased virgin opinion says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Johnson</ENAMEX> now managing director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgeson Co</ENAMEX> a proxy solicitation and investor relations firm Ever the pragmatist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Corry</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> that he realized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> is on acquisition screens all over the country It s part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USX</ENAMEX> he noted was formed 88 years ago by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">People</ENAMEX> got rich through takeovers in those days as they do today <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas F O Boyle</ENAMEX> contributed to this article
