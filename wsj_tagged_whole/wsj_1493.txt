Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi Saatchi Co</ENAMEX> has attracted offers for some of its advertising units with potential suitors including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group</ENAMEX> but has rejected them people familiar with the company said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry</ENAMEX> executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> about buying its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun Esty</ENAMEX> unit but was turned down by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chairman Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> More recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> inquired about one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> s smaller communications companies identified as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowland</ENAMEX> public relations firm by several industry executives but again was rebuffed they said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> s chairman and chief executive officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Geier Jr</ENAMEX> made the pitches in visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Saatchi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> the executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Saatchi</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> But the spokesman confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowland</ENAMEX> units He added We have no intention of selling either business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> declined comment The offers come as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19 year history Takeover speculation has been rife its consulting business is on the block and its largest shareholder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Asset Management</ENAMEX> has said it s been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company and their outlook at least for the short term is bleak In the midst of the current turmoil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> is attempting to shore up its ad businesses It named a new chief executive officer former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMS International</ENAMEX> head <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis Dreyfus</ENAMEX> It rebuffed an offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel</ENAMEX> head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> unit to lead a management buy out of all or part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> And last week people close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> and his brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> would lead a buy out if a hostile bid emerged But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> s troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> s major agency networks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi Saatchi Advertising</ENAMEX> would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts its smaller businesses are quite attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun Esty</ENAMEX> for example has had big problems at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office but offers strong offices in other areas of the country including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago That</ENAMEX> would would make it appealing to a network such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> that already has a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> presence While there would be some client conflicts they wouldn t be nearly as onerous as with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> s other agencies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Mithun</ENAMEX> also would be a sizable addition to an agency network It has billings of about 850 million and blue chip clients including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills Jeep Eagle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Brands Rowland</ENAMEX> meanwhile has expanded aggressively and now ranks as the fifth largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> public relations firm according to O Dwyer s Directory of Public Relations Firms It would be attractive to an agency such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> units include ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaffrey Mccall</ENAMEX> which has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> account and which has been attempting to buy itself back and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Marlboro</ENAMEX> a sports and event marketing firm Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> s firm stand against selling its ad units <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Louis Dreyfus</ENAMEX> in a recent interview said he might sell a marginal agency or office Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non advertising businesses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Final Four Prudential

remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency which pleaded innocent to the charges Among other things the memo contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Rubicam</ENAMEX> gave
