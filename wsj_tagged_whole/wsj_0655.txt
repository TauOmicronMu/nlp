Nicaraguan <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> may have accomplished over the weekend what his U S antagonists have failed to do revive a constituency for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> rebels Lawmakers haven t publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> parried the question at a news conference here <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturday</ENAMEX> saying only that if there s an all out military offensive that s going to change the equation 180 degrees But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s threat over the weekend to end a 19 month cease fire with the rebels seeking to topple him effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D Maine</ENAMEX> said yesterday on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC TV</ENAMEX> s Meet the Press that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s threat was a very unwise move particularly the timing of it The threat came during a two day celebration in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> to highlight <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> s progress toward democracy in the region attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> and 14 other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX> leaders <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington Saturday</ENAMEX> night <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> announced on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> that he would end the cease fire this week in response to the periodic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> assaults against his army <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturday</ENAMEX> he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease fire if the U S ends its financial support for the Contras He asked that the remaining U S humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels Not only did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region it came as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX> elections Outside observers are gathering in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates And important U S lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the 49 million in so called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration in March The humanitarian assistance which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honduras</ENAMEX> replaced the military aid cut off by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX> 1988 While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole R Kan</ENAMEX> said yesterday on Meet the Press I would hope after his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega s</ENAMEX> act yesterday or the day before we d have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Dole</ENAMEX> also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and de emphasized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s statement provides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue The administration should now state that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX> election is voided by the Sandinistas they should call for military aid said former Assistant Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">State Elliott Abrams</ENAMEX> In these circumstances I think they d win <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Mitchell</ENAMEX> said that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement to give non lethal support to the Contras through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX> elections although he added that the agreement requires that the Contras not initiate any military action <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s threat to breach the cease fire comes as U S officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">State James Baker</ENAMEX> who accompanied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> told reporters <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> I have no reason to deny reports that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> ambushed some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> soldiers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Baker</ENAMEX> s assistant for inter American affairs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Aronson</ENAMEX> while maintaining that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> had also broken the cease fire acknowledged It s never very clear who starts what He added that the U S has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease fire In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s remarks also played to the suspicions of some U S officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX> elections <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials traveling with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> interpreted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> s wavering as a sign that he isn t responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Abrams</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ortega</ENAMEX> is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency he said
