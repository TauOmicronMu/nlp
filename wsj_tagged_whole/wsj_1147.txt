The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> approved a short term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov 15 and provide 2 85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake The 321 99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance but the cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm Rudman</ENAMEX> deficit reduction law By a lopsided 401 18 margin the chamber rejected an effort to waive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm Rudman</ENAMEX> for purposes of addressing the two disasters and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least 1 44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991 and the issue forced a confrontation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> leadership and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> district was at the center of the earthquake last week Going to the well of the chamber <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Panetta</ENAMEX> demanded the costs be fully counted His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead We do not come to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> asking for any handout said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Democrat</ENAMEX> We do not intend to hide these costs from the American people The 2 85 billion package incorporates 500 million for low interest disaster loans 1 billion in highway construction funds and 1 35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters The funds are in addition to 1 1 billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX> bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly 4 billion in unanticipated spending Because of the vagaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm Rudman</ENAMEX> the immediate impact is relatively small But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991 Within the appropriations process the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight and this urgency has contributed to the speed and critics say mistakes that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance The hastily drafted measure could hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required And the state s delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate 185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year Also the high price of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average For example disaster loans which will go to small businesses and homeowners offer credit as low as 4 in some cases But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to 500 000 from 100 000 to assist the hard hit but often wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina</ENAMEX> district The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to make some modifications today but both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight s deadline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> changes are expected to be largely technical dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> loans to 1 8 billion to accommodate the increased activity expected Yesterday s floor action came as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved a nearly 8 5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill representing a 5 reduction from last year and making severe cuts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests for installations abroad An estimated 25 8 million is allocated to continue work in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oman</ENAMEX> But all funding is cut for the Philippines and projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> are cut to 13 6 million or less than a sixth of the administration s request Closer to home the negotiators were more generous An estimated 38 9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina Rep W G Hefner</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> chairman And 70 2 million would go to projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> represented by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> counterpart and fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Democrat Sen James Sasser Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> are traditionally powerful within the conference but equally striking is the dominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd D W</ENAMEX> va even added report language listing 49 4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sen Daniel Inouye D Hawaii</ENAMEX> who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> defense subcommittee In the final trading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> was insistent on setting aside 500 million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal 1990 But it gave ground to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Inouye</ENAMEX> on a number of projects ranging from a 11 million parking garage here to a land transfer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> to a provision to assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makwah Indian Tribe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> state The tribe is one of the poorest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Northwest Mr Inouye</ENAMEX> who chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs used his power to move 400 000 from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators have tentatively agreed on a 3 18 billion anti drug and anti crime intitiative cutting other federal spending 0 43 to pay for it A formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Senate</ENAMEX> conference is expected to ratify the accord later this week
