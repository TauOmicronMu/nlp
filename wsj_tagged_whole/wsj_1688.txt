<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melvin Belli</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday s earthquake In the first 25 minutes after his office s telephone service was restored yesterday morning 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self proclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torts Mr Belli</ENAMEX> like many other personal injury lawyers suspects that the earthquake which measured 6 9 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richter</ENAMEX> scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city s personal injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time Suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against local government agencies But lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge Experts on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> tort law say protections afforded government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> For now says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Drivon</ENAMEX> president elect of the 6 000 member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Trial Lawyers Association</ENAMEX> the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not We still have people wandering around in a daze in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> worrying about whether it s going to rain tonight But that won t stop plaintiffs lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> they argue an earthquake was a near certainty Therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held accountable for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster if negligence can be proven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">My</ENAMEX> prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Chesley</ENAMEX> a well known <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> plaintiffs lawyer From what he saw on television <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Chesley</ENAMEX> points out that Interstate 880 which collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever He adds that they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Andreas Fault</ENAMEX> The flamboyant and publicity conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Belli</ENAMEX> says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> and the interstate approaching it We won t know until the smoke clears but yes we re looking into it he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Belli</ENAMEX> says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Belli</ENAMEX> who was at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candlestick Park</ENAMEX> for the World Series Tuesday night says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> lawyers perhaps understandably say that plaintiffs lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually A lot of this is going to be code related says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ignazio J Ruvolo</ENAMEX> a construction law specialist at Bronson Bronson Mckinnon a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> law firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaintiffs</ENAMEX> he says will argue that damaged structures weren t built to proper design standards But if defendants can prove that they met <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> s stringent building codes that s probably going to protect them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ruvolo</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Government</ENAMEX> entities continues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ruvolo</ENAMEX> could be protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Government Tort Liability Act</ENAMEX> Under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally aren t available in the private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ruvolo</ENAMEX> says The legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability Built into the statute are so called design immunities which are likely to protect government agencies according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ruvolo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Covert</ENAMEX> a lawyer with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> which oversees the damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Covert</ENAMEX> He believes those defenses might well apply to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> collapse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevertheless</ENAMEX> he adds I wouldn t get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> If there s going to be a race to the courthouse it hasn t started yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Covert</ENAMEX> had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Belli</ENAMEX> s courtyard was strewn with bricks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wednesday Mr Belli</ENAMEX> s staff wasn t permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town house office and helped victims apply for federal aid free of charge In a news release issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Drivon</ENAMEX> the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical
