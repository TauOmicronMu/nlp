<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> critics used to complain of stop and go monetary policies They claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> that has changed A supremely cautious man the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman is forever blinking yellow Indeed his caution has become legendary within the government He fusses endlessly over economic statistics dissecting them in dozens of ways probing for hours in search of potential problems After thoroughly digesting reams of information he often concludes that more data are needed and when he finally decides to act his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small Such caution was evident after the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> the 13th stock market plunge Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets But he refused claiming that he wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> s decision to keep quiet also prompted a near mutiny within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s ranks A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> official spoke on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturday</ENAMEX> after the market swoon to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed The statement angered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman Greenspan</ENAMEX> but it was greeted with applause by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration and the financial markets And while the mutinous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> member hasn t gone public some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> governors most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson</ENAMEX> are known to have disagreed with the chairman s decision to remain silent Ironically the anonymous official s comments have earned some plaudits for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> who is mistakenly seen as the source At a hearing last week Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Chris Dodd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman Greenspan</ENAMEX> s announcement over the Oct 13 weekend was a very important statement <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Brady</ENAMEX> hesitantly replied that he wasn t sure whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> made a statement himself or whether that was a newspaper report The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman s caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market s plunge when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system And by the end of that week the key federal funds interest rate which is largely controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> had settled at 8 75 barely changed from the level of just under 9 that prevailed the previous week <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials appear increasingly concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> is cautious to a fault Signs of growing weakness in the economy paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control have caused them to wonder why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman is so grudging in reducing rates Those concerns aren t expressed in public In fact the administration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds fearing stories about an administration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> split added to the stock market s jitters Still the split is there The administration s concerns are understandable The economy is showing signs of weakness particularly among manufacturers Exports which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years seem to have stalled Factory payrolls and production fell in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> remains reluctant to loosen policy partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> banks who oppose credit easing In addition the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road Inflation may be stable at the moment running at about 4 5 But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> eases too soon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> fears prices may begin to accelerate again next year Moreover if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> holds tight it may be able gradually to reduce inflation moving toward the zero inflation goal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman embraced in testimony to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> last week So far <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> s cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession We ve gotten through two stock market crashes and we ve gone through an election without any major problems says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hale</ENAMEX> an economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemper Financial</ENAMEX> Services I think you have to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> a good rating But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession perhaps starting early next year If that happens <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman Greenspan</ENAMEX> could well become an open target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Already Congress</ENAMEX> is toying with legislation to curb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s independence If the economy turns down such proposals could gain strong momentum
