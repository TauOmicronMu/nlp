Many in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs We have a better idea <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dismantle HUD</ENAMEX> to pay for the war on drugs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Development</ENAMEX> s budget is 17 billion From what we and the nation have been reading the money isn t being spent very well The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods If that takes money take it away from this discredited federal department But of course the Democrats pillorying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind Instead they re scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal This month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD Secretary Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD No</ENAMEX> doubt many of his ideas are worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is unlikely to go even that far Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Secretary Kemp</ENAMEX> ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> members They were appalled for instance that he wanted to target more of the 3 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Development Block Grant CDBG</ENAMEX> program to low income projects and zero out the notorious discretionary funds that have allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials to steer contracts to political cronies These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages They also give those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> political credit for bringing home the pork and so they are popular with such Members as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Rose Oakar Rep Oakar</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democrat</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> wants a 6 9 million grant so <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> can build an 18 story Rock and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roll Hall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fame</ENAMEX> She says it d create 600 jobs and bring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> tourist revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> says the project doesn t qualify and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kemp</ENAMEX> says that rock n roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money At the hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Oakar</ENAMEX> started wailing about phoney baloney regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland Rep Chalmers Wylie</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio Republican</ENAMEX> rallied to the cause I think the gentlelady is making an important statement The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there s something wrong I think is most unfortunate We re sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> Our view is that given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> s attitude toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> the place probably is beyond reform For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities In the process <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> has wasted untold billions created slums and invited corruption Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> s spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class That includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CDBG</ENAMEX> funds and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be 4 billion in the hole Selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX> s loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> money actually does trickle down to the poor and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones Even suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince George s County Md</ENAMEX> reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year most of them drug related Innocent bystanders often are the victims A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> drug battle A three year old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer Decent life in the inner cities won t be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs Until then the billions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> spends on inner city housing simply is wasted It s still unclear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Secretary Kemp</ENAMEX> wants to completely overhaul the engine room at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> or just tighten a few screws here and there No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Having</ENAMEX> seen the hypocrisy with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has addressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals we disagree It s time to scrap the politically infested spending machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> has become and channel the resources into the drug war
