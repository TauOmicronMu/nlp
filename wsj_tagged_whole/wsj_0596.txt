October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation s media For one of the superstars of glasnost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitaly Korotich</ENAMEX> editor of the trail blazing weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogonyok Friday Oct</ENAMEX> 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation He had been summoned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet Communist Party</ENAMEX> after he finished his lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy Hotel</ENAMEX> an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow beating Eight foot tall Rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry chef s trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of gold Why had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Korotich</ENAMEX> been called I told my driver he said that he was taking my butt to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> so they can whack whack whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm They feel the need from time to time to educate me And indeed as he later reported that was the import of the meeting Anxious allies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> are cautioning media leaders to take it easy to be careful not to do anything that could be used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s opponents The government is nervous According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Korotich</ENAMEX> who was present <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s publicized tongue lashing of the press on Oct 13 was more of a plea Be careful boys use good judgment We re standing in gasoline so don t smoke U S and northern European diplomats confirm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Korotich</ENAMEX> s assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger In fact a very high ranking Soviet official told an American official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated The day after that conversation at the residence of the U S ambassador the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brezhnevite</ENAMEX> editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pravda Victor Afnasjev</ENAMEX> was replaced by a college classmate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brezhnevite</ENAMEX> holdovers have more to fear from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> than the verbal spanking he gave to the press At the end of the very week in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Korotich</ENAMEX> was called to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee Ogonyok</ENAMEX> was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that 35 of the Soviet population a plurality believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s economic reforms perestroika would result in only insignificant change A good measurement of the popularity of ice breaker journals like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogonyok</ENAMEX> is circulation When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Korotich</ENAMEX> took it over in 1986 it sold 250 000 copies today it sells 3 4 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pravda</ENAMEX> meanwhile has retained only 57 of its 1986 readership Glasnost has made celebrities of men like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Korotich Prevented</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> from getting on its slate of nominees for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX> he stood as an independent candidate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> from his native <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ukraine</ENAMEX> and won with 84 of the vote The same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the Party he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> party But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are there is a fragility to glasnost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Censorship</ENAMEX> isn t a Marxist invention The czars were no civil libertarians As late as the 1890s the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan s wives So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four year blink of history It is public relations of the highest sophistication that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty up to a point What is that point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Will Ogonyok</ENAMEX> begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika I d be destroying myself replies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Korotich</ENAMEX> who then asks What would that accomplish His answer reveals his vulnerability it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders Mr Ayers is editor and publisher of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anniston Ala</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX
