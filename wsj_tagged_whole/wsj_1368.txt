<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William D Forrester</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S U S S R Trade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Council</ENAMEX> has a warning for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> companies trying to do business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> It s an extremely complex market and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Forrester</ENAMEX> says We are not trying to encourage everyone Undeterred by such words of caution corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> is flocking to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> lured by a huge untapped market and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy Doing business with the Russians once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans has become the goal of such major companies as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">General</ENAMEX> Motors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp Federal Express Corp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter Gamble Co</ENAMEX> as well as a cluster of smaller firms Reflecting the new found interest more than 140 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> companies are taking part in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> exhibition organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Forrester</ENAMEX> s trade group But while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> interest may be big and growing the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating Alongside the old problems of a non convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy Western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika the restructuring of the Soviet economy Executives say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s moves to break up the government s foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players many who promise more than they can deliver And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX> parliament and the governments of the nation s republics You have to go out to all your constituents says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H Giffen</ENAMEX> who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> firms to break into the Soviet market involving investment of more than 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures As part of that attempt by the American <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Consortium Mr Giffen</ENAMEX> says he spends a lot of time lobbying Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint venture plans Over the past two years Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental Petroleum Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Combustion Engineering Inc</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Montedison S</ENAMEX> p A of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> and several Japanese groups about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants The plans have come under fire from Soviet environmentalists and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped Whatever the difficulties <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> remains committed to increasing foreign trade For political as well as economic reasons <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> companies are at the top of his priorities a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> trade show last week Talking to a small group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> executives afterwards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> appeared impatient for a big expansion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S Soviet</ENAMEX> trade which now amounts to a meager 3 billion annually The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures behind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany Finland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> According to several people present at the meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> possibly at his next summit meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush Judging</ENAMEX> by the crush at the exhibition deprived Soviet consumers are more than ready for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> products Hundreds of people lined up every day at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate Palmolive Co</ENAMEX> stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste a commodity in chronically short supply here And unruly crowds at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc</ENAMEX> s booth almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush to get a free Camel cigarette sticker Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> products are filtering into the Soviet market under an emergency import program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Both Colgate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter Gamble</ENAMEX> have received big orders for toothpaste soap and detergents The American <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Consortium</ENAMEX> says it is planning to ship some 500 million of consumer goods financed by bank credits in the first few months of next year But the current Soviet purchasing spree may be a one time affair The goal of most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> firms joint ventures remains elusive Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX> ruble isn t convertible into dollars marks and other Western currencies companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter trade transaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up however <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley M Zeiger</ENAMEX> an entrepreneur from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> who buys <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX> porcelain and matryoshka nesting dolls for export to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items Seeking to overcome the currency problems <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Giffen</ENAMEX> s American <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Consortium</ENAMEX> which comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Corp RJR Johnson Johnson Eastman Kodak Co</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Archer Daniels Midland Co</ENAMEX> has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings largely from the revenues of a planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> oil project Several medical concerns including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer Inc Hewlett Packard Co Colgate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott</ENAMEX> Laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach It s hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis A Sokol</ENAMEX> president of Medical Service Partners <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> who is putting the medical consortium together Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale One group seeks to publish a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U S Soviet</ENAMEX> medical journal in conjunction with the U S S R Ministry of Health According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard P Mills</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> based official of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> partner 10 000 copies of the quarterly will be printed in Russian from next year It will be financed by advertisements from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> companies and by simultaneous publication of an English language journal containing details of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet</ENAMEX> medical advancements We found a market niche <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mills</ENAMEX> boasts It s truly
