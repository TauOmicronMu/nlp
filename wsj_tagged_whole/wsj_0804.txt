An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed He has made speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> respectable The 6 1 turtle Pong Pagong is a character who stars in the children s television show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> He speaks only in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Filipino Batibot</ENAMEX> which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> program <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show In the process <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> an archaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> word meaning strong or enduring has become a powerful advocate of the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> language It impresses on ordinary young Filipinos that there s nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy David</ENAMEX> a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show When we started the program six years ago the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia Brown</ENAMEX> the program s creator Now she says it s no longer an issue The success of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> as a national language <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> once known as Pilipino is predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tagalog</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malay</ENAMEX> based language spoken in a part of the country s principal island of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luzon Resistance</ENAMEX> to a national language comes primarily from members of the country s elite who generally prefer English But while better off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> say advocates of the native language For the middle and upper middle class <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> is declasse says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bien Lumbera</ENAMEX> a Philippine studies professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quezon City</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of the Philippines There s also resentment Other opponents of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> come from non <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tagalog</ENAMEX> regions They argue that their own languages should have equal weight although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country s population understands <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> more than any other language There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines It is entrenched in the country s colonial bonds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippine</ENAMEX> class structure in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography As they did when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> was a colony of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> teachers for the most part teach in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children As a result they often speak one language at home another at school <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Brown</ENAMEX> calls the modern day cultural ambivalence to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> a language schizophrenia The issue has been simmering for years It doesn t take much to provoke an intense debate When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Corazon Aquino</ENAMEX> whose command of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> is spotty announced last year that the language would be used in official communications there was an uproar from many legislators who continue to conduct debates mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English</ENAMEX> But many proponents of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> see resistance to the language finally crumbling They believe the media including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> have played a crucial role According to chief scriptwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Villanueva Batibot</ENAMEX> doesn t set out to advance the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filipino</ENAMEX> It s not as if we re teaching language per se he says We re just using it These days <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of 3 000 a one hour segment It is shown weekdays on two of the country s five networks With an audience totaling more than 400 000 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> consistently ranks in the country s top four most watched daytime programs But advertising revenue is inadequate Periodically there are threats that the program will fold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> lacks the polish of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sesame Street Sound</ENAMEX> stages echo Acting sometimes falls flat There are only two large puppets in the program Pong Pagong and a monkey named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kiko Matsing</ENAMEX> But the production is the equal of any local program And the show s creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies The program isn t afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment Not that the language war is won even on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batibot</ENAMEX> During one recent episode all the advertisements were in <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>English</ENAMEX>
