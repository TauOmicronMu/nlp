Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> s near record deficits Chancellor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exchequer Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> s restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor s failure to announce any new policy measures in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mansion House</ENAMEX> speech last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 from their current 15 level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dillow</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX> If there is another bad trade number there could be an awful lot of pressure noted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon Briscoe U K</ENAMEX> economist for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland Montagu</ENAMEX> a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Bank PLC Forecasts</ENAMEX> for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the 2 billion 3 2 billion deficit in the current account reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> deficit and the 2 2 billion gap registered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> are topped only by the 2 3 billion deficit of October 1988 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sanjay Joshi European</ENAMEX> economist at Baring Brothers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX> said there is no sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports At the same time he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only 1 8 billion in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> However <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dillow</ENAMEX> said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports Combined with at least some rebound in exports after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> s unexpected decline the deficit could narrow to as little as 1 3 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Briscoe</ENAMEX> who also forecasts a 1 3 billion current account gap warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency won t advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions Nevertheless he noted No one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound Meanwhile overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mansion House</ENAMEX> speech <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> base rates are at their highest level in eight years But consumer expenditure data released <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> don t suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> economy is slowing that quickly The figures show that spending rose 0 1 in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3 8 from a year ago This compares with a 1 6 rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5 4 increase from the second quarter of 1988 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dillow</ENAMEX> said the data show the economy is still quite strong but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises Certainly the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling doesn t decline further <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> he reminded his audience that the government can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary And they warn any further drop in the government s popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sterling</ENAMEX> was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s promise <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> In European trading it declined to 1 5890 and 2 9495 marks from 1 5940 and 2 9429 marks late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday Economists</ENAMEX> suggested that if the pound falls much below 2 90 marks the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> s Market Activity The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange which has preoccupied the market since Oct 13 when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> plunged more than 190 points <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Currency</ENAMEX> analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S Federal Reserve Late</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX
