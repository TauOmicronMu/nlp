Some important people plan to gather here soon to say nice things about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian P Monieson</ENAMEX> The occasion isn t a tribute to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> chairman however but a hearing at which federal commodity regulators hope to ban him from the futures industry The Commodity Futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trading Commission</ENAMEX> alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> was warned that some brokers at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP Commodities Inc</ENAMEX> were bilking investors and that he failed to stop them promptly One of the brokers in question was one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> s best friends The case has become the most closely watched civil commodity enforcement action in recent memory with the futures industry s top officials rallying to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> s defense His scheduled character witnesses at the Nov 6 hearing include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter</ENAMEX> who was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> president under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson Leo Melamed</ENAMEX> chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc s</ENAMEX> executive committee and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert K Wilmouth</ENAMEX> president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Futures Association</ENAMEX> an industry funded regulatory group <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> s attorney in the matter is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerrold E Salzman</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> s influential outside counsel The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> brokers allegedly allocated trades meaning they initiated futures trades without the required customer account numbers and then kept the profitable ones for themselves and stuck customers with the losers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> a childhood math whiz and self described computer nerd denies these charges and expects that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> will be exonerated Noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> processed some nine million trades last year he says Who the heck would know what s going on with 50 trades out of nine million If he loses at the hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> can appeal to the full panel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> commissioners and then to the federal courts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs Melamed Salzman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilmouth</ENAMEX> came to their friend s aid despite the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Futures Association</ENAMEX> brought similar failure to supervise charges against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> though not against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> personally To some the case shows the fallacy of self regulation a concept the futures industry cherishes In theory traders and brokers will police themselves because widespread fraud would discredit the industry and frighten away investors This enlightened self interest is supposed to overcome the built in conflicts of interest The problem with self regulation is always that the regulators are tinged with self interest says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX> the just departed chairman of the Securities and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> In this case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ruder</ENAMEX> says it would seem they re acting in two capacities that people of that stature would testify in a disciplinary case One would counsel the avoidance of an appearance of a conflict <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Ruder</ENAMEX> adds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Yeutter</ENAMEX> It seems odd that people in high government positions would intervene to testify <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Salzman</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> gave him permission to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> adding there s no conflict because he has recused himself from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> s case I ve had a long personal relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mr Salzman</ENAMEX> says I couldn t say no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Melamed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wilmouth</ENAMEX> both said they see no conflict because their organizations didn t charge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> personally and they re only testifying to his character <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Yeutter</ENAMEX> couldn t be reached for comment In an interview in his corner office in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> tower <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> contends he is a victim of his own celebrity The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> was looking for something high profile he says The investigation already has been costly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> 1987 he was two weeks away from the sale of his firm for as much as 40 million But the deal hit a snag The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> which had to approve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> s sale to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque Indosuez</ENAMEX> a French bank learned of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> investigation A distressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> and asked its two top lawyers no fewer than five times to divulge confidential details of its probe into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> They refused even after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> warned that the deal s collapse would become an international incident between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> according to a memo one of the lawyers wrote The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque Indosuez</ENAMEX> deal fell through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> 53 years old wears the expensive clothes of a successful trader but his mannerisms are more those of a preoccupied math professor His office is filled with toy pigs to remind him of the fortune he made trading pork bellies And behind his desk hangs a more recent sign of success a futures trader s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Picasso</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leroy Nieman</ENAMEX> painting depicting a horse race <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> s defense at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> hearing will partly be that he is a busy man and wasn t personally involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> s retail brokerage business During his years as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> chairman 1983 through 1985 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> played host to prime ministers and crown princes his attorneys have prepared charts showing the many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> meetings he attended and the time he spent away on business The lawyers probably won t mention his interest in horse racing though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> says it remains a hobby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> born on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Side</ENAMEX> by age five was a faithful reader of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Racing Form</ENAMEX> regularly joining his father at the track he says Later he bet the ponies with a high school friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Rosenthal</ENAMEX> who would become his partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> and other ventures In 1965 he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rosenthal</ENAMEX> set up what would become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indecon Inc</ENAMEX> a computer processing firm An early offshoot was their computerized tip sheet for harness racing cranked out using the same type of equipment used in important space research and big business <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> told subscribers Programming unexpectedly led him into trading in the early 1970s when a customer a pork processor commissioned a computer program on the supply and demand of bacon but never used the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rosenthal</ENAMEX> got together 50 000 and started trading pork belly futures at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> based on the program s predictions They formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> in 1973 not out of any desire to run a futures clearing firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> says but because they were tired of paying brokerage commissions A decade later <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> was trading all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> floor mostly in financial futures Yet pork bellies still held a fascination for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> and his trading in that pit would earn him a dubious distinction the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> chairman to be found guilty of committing trading violations while running the exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rosenthal</ENAMEX> were fined 10 000 and 70 000 respectively for taking speculative positions beyond the exchange s limits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rosenthal</ENAMEX> s fine was bigger because he allegedly had exceeded position limits before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> likening the fine to a parking ticket says he did violate the rules but contends the position limits are set too low for today s trading environment Three associates held pork belly positions nearly identical to those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> owners and appeared to be acting at their direction according to an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> account of the case A company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rosenthal</ENAMEX> lent the other traders more than 6 5 million to help finance the trades One of the associates was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Furlett</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> salesman and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> s closest friends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Furlett</ENAMEX> s job was to call up investors and get them to trade futures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> got a commission <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira P Greenspon</ENAMEX> was in the same line of work and in October 1985 joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> didn t know was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspon</ENAMEX> already was under investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> for alleged trade allocating at his previous firm The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> later concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Furlett</ENAMEX> had been allocating trades as well According to separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> charges against the two men and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> which haven t been made public during the first two months of 1986 accounts they maintained including one named Horse Trading had profits of 62 372 95 Four customer accounts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> reviewed had combined losses of 20 988 12 for those months <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert L Sutermeister</ENAMEX> a retired trucking company owner in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton Ohio</ENAMEX> says he lost nearly all of the 10 000 he sent the brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Margler</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mckinleyville Ca</ENAMEX> engineer says he lost about 3 000 of the 5 000 he turned over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Furlett Between June</ENAMEX> 1985 and May 1986 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> alleges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Monieson</ENAMEX> was warned by at least five <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> employees that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Furlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspon</ENAMEX> were defrauding customers After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque Indosuez</ENAMEX> deal collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> 1987 the two salesmen left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP Their</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Koch</ENAMEX> says they deny any wrongdoing and that both men have agreed to leave the futures industry
