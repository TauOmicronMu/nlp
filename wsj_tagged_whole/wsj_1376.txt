As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX> who owns an art porcelain company sipped her luncheon cocktail she reeled off the names of a few pals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles Princess Diana Sarah Ferguson John Kluge Milton Petrie</ENAMEX> Then flashing a diamond ring as big as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ritz</ENAMEX> my day diamond darling she told her two companions that she is on the board of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> As it turns out the board has a lot of important members including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winton Blount</ENAMEX> former postmaster general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">U S Mrs Henry Gaisman</ENAMEX> widow of the inventor of auto strop razor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Murphy</ENAMEX> an investment banker at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Co</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Boehm</ENAMEX> didn t mention any of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX> has a way with names says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Revson</ENAMEX> a gossip columnist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> and son of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Revson</ENAMEX> a founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon</ENAMEX> Like which are droppable and which are not With the fall social season well under way name droppers are out in force trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers But the truth is that almost everyone from real estate agents to city fathers name drops and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Katzenjammer Kids</ENAMEX> In case you have forgotten his name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Dirks Name</ENAMEX> dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Freudenberger</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> psychoanalyst with a high powered clientele It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you don t know Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza Minnelli</ENAMEX> I was having a drink in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sardi</ENAMEX> s when all of a sudden I saw a woman s backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks I knew it was someone important so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza So</ENAMEX> I said Hello And she said Hello Can you imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza</ENAMEX> said hello to me Some people must drop names call it an irresistible impulse They can t help talking about the big important people they know even if they don t really know them says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dr Freudenberger Beauregard Houston Montgomery</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> writer who changed his name from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Stretch</ENAMEX> in 1980 is an inveterate name dropper I do it innately and pathologically and while it may occasionally get me into trouble it s also gotten me access to parties and society he says Name dropping recently helped <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Houston Montgomery</ENAMEX> crash a party <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fame</ENAMEX> magazine threw for 100 of the 2 809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Warhol</ENAMEX> I guess I might have asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beauregard</ENAMEX> to leave but he drops so many good names we decided to let him stay says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Greenberg</ENAMEX> publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fame</ENAMEX> After all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warhol</ENAMEX> was the ultimate namedropper dropping five a day in his diaries And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beauregard</ENAMEX> was mentioned twice although very briefly and in passing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mr Houston Montgomery</ENAMEX> says that at the party he waved to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Forbes</ENAMEX> publisher of Forbes magazine We ve been in the columns together <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Boone</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> art dealer I I think she knows me but I m not sure and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridget Fonda</ENAMEX> the actress She knows me but we re not really the best of friends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Revson</ENAMEX> the gossip columnist says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party These droppers don t flaunt only their friendships with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trumps Brooke Astor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georgette Mosbacher</ENAMEX> They even drop semi obscure names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Flottl</ENAMEX> whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Revson</ENAMEX> It s the one upsmanship of name dropping that counts But name dropping has other benefits often civic In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Take Cleveland</ENAMEX> It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuyahoga River</ENAMEX> caught fire because former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayor Ralph Perk</ENAMEX> set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock n <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roll Hall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fame</ENAMEX> was recently refused an urban development grant Some people call it The Mistake on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Lake Erie</ENAMEX> that is It helps to point out how many important people came through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> on their way to the top says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Miller</ENAMEX> executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Cleveland Campaign</ENAMEX> a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city s strengths <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> notes that actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Newman</ENAMEX> s family owned a sporting goods store in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> that the late actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Hamilton</ENAMEX> who played the bad witch in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wizard</ENAMEX> Of Oz once ran a nursery school in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> and that comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hope</ENAMEX> s father a stonemason once worked on a church next to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Severence Hall Cleveland</ENAMEX> s main concert hall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power</ENAMEX> names like that don t hurt the city s reputation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Miller</ENAMEX> says In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous Why we even just sold a three bedroom house in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van Nuys</ENAMEX> and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real estate market by noting that the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lone Ranger</ENAMEX> lived there says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Rambo</ENAMEX> a sales associate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Douglas Co</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> real estate agency Most people can t even remember his name It is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hart Mr Rambo</ENAMEX> says that a 3 2 acre property overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX> is priced at 4 million because the late actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erroll Flynn</ENAMEX> once lived there If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flynn</ENAMEX> hadn t lived there the property might have been priced 1 million lower says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rambo</ENAMEX> noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flynn</ENAMEX> s house has been bulldozed and only the swimming pool remains Press agents and public relations practitioners are notorious name droppers And some even do it with malice aforethought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Len Kessler</ENAMEX> a financial publicist in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him He says that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Dorfman</ENAMEX> a financial columnist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> hasn t returned his phone calls he leaves messages with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Dorfman</ENAMEX> s office saying that he has an important story on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump Meshulam Riklis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions But it does get him to return my calls and it makes me feel better for the times he s given me the brushoff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kessler</ENAMEX> says There are of course obvious dangers to blatant unsubstantiated name dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffry Thal</ENAMEX> a publicity agent for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lantz Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud Get caught and you re dead in the water says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Thal Mr Thal</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX> a client hates being called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> If directors or producers phone me and say they know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX> I know they ve never met her She prefers <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> society <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buckley</ENAMEX> the very social wife of

But call her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty</ENAMEX> and it s a sure giveaway you re not in her circle because she doesn t use that name says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Kron</ENAMEX> editor in chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avenue</ENAMEX> magazine a monthly publication sent to all the right names <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Spencer Churchill</ENAMEX> a nephew of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> former prime minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> isn t that impressed with most name droppers he meets That s because they only drop mere names says
