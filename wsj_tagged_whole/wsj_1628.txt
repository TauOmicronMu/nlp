<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats favoring a cut in the capital gains tax have decided under pressure from their leaders not to offer their own proposal placing another obstacle in the path of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> s legislative priority A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets The plan was complete except for finishing touches and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D Maine</ENAMEX> a vigorous opponent of the capital gains tax cut called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Mitchell</ENAMEX> urged them to desist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterward</ENAMEX> leaders of the dissident Democrats relented and said they wouldn t offer their own proposal as they had planned The decision is a setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder Still <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sen Bob Packwood R Ore</ENAMEX> the lead sponsor of the Republican capital gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Mitchell</ENAMEX> buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats strongly disagreed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mitchell</ENAMEX> has been predicting that the president s initiative would fail this year Yesterday in an interview he added that the Democrats decision increases the likelihood that a capital gains tax cut will not pass this year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mitchell</ENAMEX> s first victory came last week when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> passed a deficit reduction bill that didn t contain a capital gains provision That vote made it unlikely that a capital gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> version of the bill does include the tax cut Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit reduction legislation To help lay the groundwork for that fight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> plans early next week to meet at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital gains tax or are undecided on the issue The president apparently will have only one bill to push <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sen Packwood</ENAMEX> s and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen David Boren D Okla</ENAMEX> a leader of those Democrats The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35 after seven years The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct 1 As an alternative taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index For corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 from the current top rate of 34 That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 for corporate assets held for 15 years The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan also would include a proposal designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen William Roth R Del</ENAMEX> that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> plan would create a new non deductible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> from which money could be withdrawn tax free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Current Iras</ENAMEX> could be rolled over into the new Iras but would be subject to tax though no penalty
