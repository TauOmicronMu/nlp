The surprise resignation yesterday of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Chancellor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exchequer Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the British economy The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling s tumble as market participants switched out of pounds The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark falling below the key 2 90 mark level to 2 8956 marks from 2 9622 marks late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wednesday Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s resignation shocked many analysts despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> Indeed only hours earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> had called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s economic policies sound and said she has always supported him There was a general feeling that we d seen the worst said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Foley</ENAMEX> deputy chief economic adviser for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> The resignation came as a great surprise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Beale</ENAMEX> manager of foreign exchange operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s comments reinforced the market s growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit s later decline The market was caught totally the wrong way Everyone was extremely long on sterling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Beale</ENAMEX> said In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at 1 8400 marks up from 1 8353 marks late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wednesday</ENAMEX> and at 142 10 yen up from 141 52 yen late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wednesday Sterling</ENAMEX> was quoted at 1 5765 sharply down from 1 6145 late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wednesday</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo Friday</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at 142 02 yen up from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 141 90 yen Few analysts had much good to say about the pound s near term prospects despite the fact that most don t anticipate a shift in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s economic policies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Foley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s replacement <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX> the British foreign minister will take time to establish his credibility and in the meantime sterling could trend downward in volatile trade But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Foley</ENAMEX> predicted few economic policy changes ahead commenting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Major</ENAMEX> shares a very similar view of the world with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson Bob Chandross</ENAMEX> chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> also noted that the pound s sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> economic policies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unless Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s resignation leads to a change in British interest rate policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check or posturing toward full inclusion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> s exchange rate mechanism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s withdrawal will have little long term impact on exchange rates <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Chandross</ENAMEX> concluded Also announcing his resignation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s economic adviser and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s nemesis The pound which had been trading at about 1 6143 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s announcement sank more than two cents to 1 5930 prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> to buy pounds for dollars The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s move however only proved a stopgap to the pound s slide and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> intervened for a second time at around 1 5825 according to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> traders Meanwhile dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session according to dealers who noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> s release of the preliminary report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> third quarter gross national product was something of a nonevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S GNP</ENAMEX> rose at an annual rate of 2 5 in the third quarter The implicit price deflator a measure of inflation was down to a 2 9 annual rate of increase in the quarter from a 4 6 rate of gain in the second quarter In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> the dollar ended lower in dull trading The market closed prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s
