<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs He wants it now Not so fast says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Mickey Edwards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX> I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century he says It s the line item veto a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> without vetoing the entire bill Whatever one thinks of the idea it s far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance Rather it s a device that could send shock waves through the president s entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> badly wants a line item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is declaring that he might not rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> which hasn t shown any willingness to surrender such authority to pass the line item veto law he seeks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesmen last week said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> is considering simply declaring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> gives him the power exercising a line item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> it would set off a political earthquake The ramifications are enormous says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Don Edwards</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Democrat</ENAMEX> who is a senior member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> It s a real face to face arm wrestling challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress White House</ENAMEX> aides know it s a step that can t be taken lightly and for that reason the president may back down from launching a test case this year Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital gains tax cut and a budget reduction bill looming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> already has enough pending confrontations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> They prefer to put off the line item veto until at least next year Still <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line item veto The issue arose last week when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vice President Dan Quayle</ENAMEX> told an audience in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> was looking for a test case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> was interested in the idea but cautioned that there wasn t a firm decision to try it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Reagan</ENAMEX> and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process They maintain that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills Those bills can t easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line item veto to use on state budgets More provocatively some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> doesn t need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I Section 7 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> that states Every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Representatives may be necessary except on a question of adjournment shall be presented to the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> States and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or disapproved by him This clause they argue is designed to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a bill and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole R Kan</ENAMEX> for one accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> to use the line item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional There s little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court and that it would quickly make its way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to be ultimately resolved It s a major issue and they wouldn t want to leave it at a lower level says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Glazier</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> attorney whose writings have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line item veto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Edwards</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Democrat</ENAMEX> is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> in the courts arguing a line item veto would expand a president s powers far beyond anything the framers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> had in mind It puts this president in the legislative business he declares That s not what our fathers had in mind In addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Rep Edwards</ENAMEX> argues a line item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers He notes that as a lawmaker from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> system If a president had a line item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign policy initiative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Edwards</ENAMEX> says the president could call and declare that he would single handedly kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BART</ENAMEX> funds unless the congressman shapes up on the foreign policy issue Proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line item veto more judiciously than that But there may be another problem with the device Despite all the political angst it would cause it mightn t be effective in cutting the deficit Big chunks of the government budget like the entitlement programs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and Medicare wouldn t be affected Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity And it isn t even clear that some pork barrel projects can be hit with a line item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves Still proponents contend that the veto would have what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Glazier</ENAMEX> calls an important chilling effect on all manner of appropriations bills Lawmakers they say would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line item veto later Whatever the outcome of a test case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Fisher</ENAMEX> a scholar at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Research Service</ENAMEX> who specializes in executive legislative relations Republicans have as much interest as Democrats in the way the system works he notes Indeed although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line item veto some ranging from liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon Sen Mark Hatfield</ENAMEX> to conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Edwards</ENAMEX> are opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Edwards</ENAMEX> voices the traditional conservative view that it s a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person Conservatives pushing for a line item veto now he notes may regret it later <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sometime</ENAMEX> you re going to have a Democratic president again who ll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives Every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Representatives may be necessary except on a question of adjournment shall be presented to the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> States and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or being disapproved by him shall be repassed by two thirds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Representatives according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution Article</ENAMEX> I Section 7 Clause
