<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste Management</ENAMEX> has turned into one of the market s best performing stocks by advancing 76 in the past year Its reward a swarm of short sellers Short sellers are backwards investors They borrow stock and sell it hoping the price will go down Eventually the shorts must cover by purchasing shares to replace the borrowed ones But if a stock declines enough in the meantime they profit What with all the garbage disposal problems clogging the headlines it s easy to see why the shares of the nation s largest hazardous waste concern have zoomed ahead to yesterday s close of a post split 22 1 8 But the stock now trades at a dizzying 32 times the latest 12 month earnings for the company more than double the multiple of the market as a whole That handsome multiple a badge of success is also a red flag for the shorts who like to bet that a stock can t stay hot forever Between Sept 15 and Oct 13 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> says the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste Management</ENAMEX> shares sold short leaped to 5 3 million from 1 9 million the largest increase for any stock on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> The company says it hasn t any idea who is doing the shorting or why A spokesman said he can t comment further because a stock offering is in progress The offering will increase the public s stake to 23 and decrease that of the parent company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waste Management</ENAMEX> to 77 from 81 Money managers and analysts generally agree that the stock has had a huge run and is now expensive Some go further and say that owning it could be well hazardous We love the company we expect to be owners again but we think for the moment it s at least adequately priced says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Levine</ENAMEX> a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiss Peck Greer</ENAMEX> The firm sold much of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste</ENAMEX> holding earlier this year government filings show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Levine</ENAMEX> says he can understand short sellers motivation When they see a

Flow Investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fort Lee N J</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste</ENAMEX> is not my cup of tea It sells for 38 times operating cash flow he says while the typical industrial company sells for only 7 7 times that yardstick <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pricey</ENAMEX> though it may be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste</ENAMEX> still is a risky short sale candidate It has a superb record of earnings growth and a strong balance sheet Citing those attributes several well known short sellers say they aren t the ones doing the shorting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shorting</ENAMEX> because of a high stock price alone is a recipe for death said Julian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robertson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Chemical Waste Management</ENAMEX> is not our kind of short said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Feshbach</ENAMEX> one of the three brothers who run <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feshbach</ENAMEX> Brothers generally considered the nation s largest short selling firm The company he said is too well capitalized to go away But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr

shorted the shares of one small company which he wouldn t name Analysts say hazardous waste companies that have posted disappointing earnings include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canonie Environmental Services Environmental Systems Groundwater Technology Gundle Environmental</ENAMEX> Systems and Rollins Environmental Services But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste</ENAMEX> s earnings for the third quarter were sparkling says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay Hahn</ENAMEX> an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago Corp</ENAMEX> She recommends the stock and says short sellers are taking their life in their hands Also bullish is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remy Fisher</ENAMEX> a vice president with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J W Seligman Co</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New

TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste</ENAMEX> s growth prospects she says She points out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Waste</ENAMEX> has about 40 of the hazardous waste industry s revenue and that it s hard for new firms to enter the field because of government regulations and neighborhood opposition to hazardous waste treatment plants Nevertheless some analysts expect <ENAMEX
