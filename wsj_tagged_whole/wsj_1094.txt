As a presidential candidate in 1980 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolling Stone</ENAMEX> magazine published that March What did he think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> s decision legalizing abortion I happen to think it was right <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> said flatly A few months later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> s running mate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suddenly George Bush</ENAMEX> the pro choice advocate became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> the anti abortionist And the vacillation didn t end there Just a month ago <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds except to save a woman s life Then two weeks ago declaring that I m not looking for any conflict over this the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest But only four days after that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> resurrected the veto threat I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother s life is threatened he proclaimed and finally vetoed the measure last weekend So what does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> really believe The answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue The result is mistrust and criticism from all around Anti abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally In all honesty if you ask me Is this man a true believer I don t know says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fowler</ENAMEX> head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Hoc Committee</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Inc Yet</ENAMEX> abortion rights forces remain bitterly critical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Gould</ENAMEX> vice president of communications for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planned Parenthood Federation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> calls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> s position on the abortion funding issue extremely cruel adding The guy hasn t done one thing about prevention He s totally geared to a punitive position <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question For most of the past nine years he has striven to convince anti abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position But ever since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster vs Reproductive Health</ENAMEX> Services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> s problem isn t so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it experts insist If you have a position you re better off to stick with it than to move around very much says Republican strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sears</ENAMEX> The need for consistency is especially acute for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> who <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr Sears</ENAMEX> maintains lacks a strong ideological base By his moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX> heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion rights arguments Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard line rhetoric and promises he made to anti abortion activists during his long pursuit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> On many issues flag burning for instance his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion rights movement would be aroused following last summer s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision to restrict those rights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> case It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes I ve ever seen says former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> pollster <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wirthlin</ENAMEX> These days when others raise the subject of abortion the usually loquacious president can be close mouthed almost to the point of curtness Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti abortion stance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">My</ENAMEX> position is well known and well stated he replied A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> has well stated his views on all sides of the issue In 1974 as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> representative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Nations he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in expanding family planning services for the poor Running for president in early 1980 he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape incest and to save the life of the mother In his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolling Stone</ENAMEX> interview in 1980 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> volunteered his abortion rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> In addition to supporting the landmark <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wade Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision legalizing abortion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Reagan</ENAMEX> was promising to promote As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Reagan</ENAMEX> s running mate though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> plunged headlong into the anti abortion position endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion He acknowledged only one difference with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Reagan</ENAMEX> that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman s life Throughout the early 1980s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it In April 1986 then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vice President Bush</ENAMEX> had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape incest and life endangerment but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> convention last year he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape incest and life endangerment His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office affirming his firm support of our cause during an anti abortion rally three days after his inauguration last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion But when the high court ruled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> case in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> the president began to lower the volume When the ruling was handed down the vacationing president dispatched Chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staff John Sununu</ENAMEX> to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> s right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Nations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population Fund</ENAMEX> But in the months since then while trying to drum up support for other issues such as an anti flag burning constitutional amendment he has shied away from talking about abortion What few comments he has initiated have been oblique such as urging greater efforts toward the protection of human life at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> last month The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> has likewise avoided any involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> s recent special legislative session on abortion which anti abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions The session failed to enact any new curbs Now some see Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Ruberg</ENAMEX> head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Mainstream Committee</ENAMEX> a group of party moderates observes The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult if not impossible to get itself out of
