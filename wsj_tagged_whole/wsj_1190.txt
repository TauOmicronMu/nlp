<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc</ENAMEX> is considering a legal challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications Inc</ENAMEX> s plan to buy half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime Networks Inc</ENAMEX> a move that could lead to all out war between the cable industry s two most powerful players <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> is also fighting the transaction on other fronts by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications</ENAMEX> as investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> cable TV industry executives say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> officials declined to comment Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications</ENAMEX> agreed to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Inc</ENAMEX> 225 million for a 50 stake in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> subsidiary which is a distant second to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Box Office</ENAMEX> in the delivery of pay TV networks to cable subscribers Tele Communications the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> s largest cable company said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> s largest customer and the two have a number of other business relationships Earlier this year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> even discussed bringing Tele Communications in as an investor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> executives at both companies said The purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> stake is a direct slap in our face said one senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> is expected to mount a legal challenge in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S District Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> in May filed a 2 5 billion antitrust suit charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> with monopolizing the pay TV business and trying to crush competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> Executives involved in plotting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications</ENAMEX> as defendants The executives say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele Communications from dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> in any of its cable systems in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime Viacom</ENAMEX> officials declined to comment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Kern Tele Communications</ENAMEX> chief outside counsel said he wasn t aware of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s legal plans But he said that any effort by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> to characterize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> as anti competitive would be the pot calling the kettle black It s hard to see how an investment by the largest cable operator in the weaker of the two networks is anti competitive when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest cable operator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kern</ENAMEX> said In addition to owning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> with 22 million subscribers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> separately operates cable TV system serving about 5 6 million cable TV subscribers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications</ENAMEX> controls close to 12 million cable subscribers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> has about one million In its suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Viacom</ENAMEX> says the ownership of both cable systems and cable programming networks gives the company too much market power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> argues that in joining up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications Viacom</ENAMEX> has potentially more power particularly since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> also owns cable networks <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MTV VH</ENAMEX> 1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nick</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nite Ironically Tele Communications</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> have often worked closely in the cable business Together they control nearly 40 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> Systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc Tele Communications</ENAMEX> has a 21 8 stake while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> has a 17 8 stake But since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> Communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> relations between the two have become strained Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated Meanwhile some legal observers say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele Communications</ENAMEX> investment and other developments are weakening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> s antitrust suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Viacom</ENAMEX> accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> in its suit of refusing to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> or a sister service The Movie Channel on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan Cable</ENAMEX> TV system one of the nation s largest urban systems But yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan Cable</ENAMEX> announced it will launch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> on Nov 1 to over 230 000 subscribers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> has also accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> of locking up the lion s share of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> s movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> has continued to sign new contracts with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studios and yesterday announced it will buy movies from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> Pictures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Inc</ENAMEX> which currently has a non
