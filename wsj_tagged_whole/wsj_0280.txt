Frequent Drinker Offer Stirs Up Spirited Debate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TO GRAB</ENAMEX> a bigger piece of the declining scotch market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Co</ENAMEX> has launched a controversial frequent drinker promotion for its Chivas Regal brand Under the program dubbed Chivas Class customers who send in two labels from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chivas</ENAMEX> bottles will receive an upgrade in seating class on some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World</ENAMEX> Airlines flights Repeat customers also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse some liquor marketers consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> s frequent buyer promotion risky I m surprised they re doing this says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penn Kavanagh</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schieffelin Somerset Co</ENAMEX> which markets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnnie Walker</ENAMEX> scotches I would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more you get more Others question the impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chivas</ENAMEX> s upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels It s really bizarre says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Lerman</ENAMEX> creative director at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich Greene</ENAMEX> ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chivas</ENAMEX> has an image of something you would savor rather than guzzle Chivas Class isn t the first such promotion Last year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J B Scotch</ENAMEX> offered 500 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> frequent flier miles in exchange for a label And Dewar s gave discounts on Scottish merchandise to people who sent in bottle labels But the scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chivas</ENAMEX> promotion sets it apart The current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three to five year direct marketing plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12 month period says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Shaw</ENAMEX> vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> direct marketing We re not asking them to save up 50 proof of purchases We re not saying drink more we re saying trade up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> Concocts a Milk For Hispanic Tastes MOST FOOD companies these days are trimming the fat and cholesterol content of their products to appeal to health conscious consumers But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> Foods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> believes it can milk some sales by bucking the trend The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Secaucus N J</ENAMEX> company has formed a joint venture with a distributor called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Lecheria</ENAMEX> to market a higher fat milk targeted at Hispanic consumers To give Leche Fresca the creamier taste <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> says Hispanics prefer the new brand has a butterfat content of 3 8 That compares with 3 5 butterfat for whole milk A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden Inc</ENAMEX> the nation s largest milk producer concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> may be on to something <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden</ENAMEX> sells considerably more whole milk than reduced fat milks in southern and Hispanic markets he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden</ENAMEX> even tested a milk with 4 butterfat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> but decided the market was too small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> And it s adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Ricca</ENAMEX> sales director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Lecheria</ENAMEX> Because of Leche Fresca s success he says the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to Hispanic tastes Jewelry Makers Copy Cosmetics Sales Ploys FOR <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">YEARS</ENAMEX> costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired And the merchandise was well fake As a result marketers of faux gems steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals cosmetics makers But lately retailers say fake has become more fashionable And jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks honed in the aggressive world of cosmetics Last year the total women s fashion jewelry business topped 4 9 billion says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Alberg</ENAMEX> editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Accessories</ENAMEX> magazine And it s growing fast with annual sales gains of more than 10 To increase their share of that business jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trifari</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monet</ENAMEX> units and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swank Inc</ENAMEX> maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Klein</ENAMEX> jewelry are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies They re hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels and they re even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business offering a gift when consumers make a purchase We ve started trying just about anything to keep sales moving in the stores says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Renk</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swank</ENAMEX> vice president But there are limits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Renk</ENAMEX> says retailers nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs Her idea bring in live zoo

says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew E Philip</ENAMEX> president <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trifari</ENAMEX> now trains sales help to advise customers on the best earring styles But cosmetics firms still have one big marketing edge They motivate sales people with commissions Jewelry makers rarely pay commissions and aren t expected to anytime soon Odds and Ends DESPITE GROWING interest in the environment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> consumers haven t shown much interest in refillable packages for household products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter Gamble Co</ENAMEX> recently introduced refillable versions of four products including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Clean</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> but doesn t
