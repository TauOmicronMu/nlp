Insurers may see claims resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake totaling nearly 1 billion far less than the claims they face from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months The property claims service division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Insurance</ENAMEX> Services Group estimated insured losses from the earthquake at 960 million This estimate doesn t include claims under workers compensation life health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges highways and public buildings The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the 4 billion in claims that insurers face from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> which ripped through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and the Carolinas last month That s because only about 30 of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses However insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area earthquake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX> and last week s explosion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips Petroleum Co</ENAMEX> s refinery in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena Texas</ENAMEX> will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump Other insurance rates such as casualty insurance which would cover liability claims aren t likely to firm right away says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Cornish</ENAMEX> an industry analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northington Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Conn</ENAMEX> She believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes isn t likely to halt the growth of the industry s surplus capital next year Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first analysts and brokers believe The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Rosencrants</ENAMEX> director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interstate Johnson Lane Inc</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta Insurers</ENAMEX> typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm a reinsurance company which in turn accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp Transamerica Corp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life Casualty Co</ENAMEX> buy reinsurance from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> based companies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX> s of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> for one catastrophe at a time After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX> hit many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year After the earthquake two weeks ago brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX> s syndicates turned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> market excess lines for protection of their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Snedeker</ENAMEX> senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill Roeser Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> based reinsurance broker says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990 However companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat or perhaps even decline slightly Many companies will be negotiating their 1990 reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks It s a seller s market said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Snedeker</ENAMEX> of the reinsurance market right now But some large insurers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co</ENAMEX> don t purchase reinsurance but fund their own program A few years ago <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> the nation s largest home insurer stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self reinsure The 472 million of losses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> expects from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX> and an additional 300 million from the earthquake are less than 5 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> s 16 7 billion total net worth Since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake it s impossible to get a clear picture of the quake s impact on fourth quarter earnings said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Goodfriend</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Bache</ENAMEX> Securities <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp Transamerica</ENAMEX> expects an after tax charge of less than 3 million against fourth quarter net <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartford Insurance Group</ENAMEX> a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Corp</ENAMEX> expects a 15 million or 10 cents after tax charge and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fireman</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fund Corp</ENAMEX> expects a charge of no more than 50 million before taxes and after using its reinsurance
