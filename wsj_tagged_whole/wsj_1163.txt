When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity Repertory Theater</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Bogart</ENAMEX> its artistic director last spring the nation s theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammerstein</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX> is decidedly downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity Rep</ENAMEX> meanwhile is one of the nation s oldest and most respected regional theaters still hosting an annual A Christmas Carol How would this bastion of traditional values fare in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> s iconoclastic hands She held her fire with her first production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity</ENAMEX> earlier this season It was a predictable revival of her prize winning off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> anthology of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertolt Brecht</ENAMEX> s theoretical writings called No Plays No Poetry Now with the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxim Gorky</ENAMEX> s bourgeois bashing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Summerfolk Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> has laid her cards on the table <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hers</ENAMEX> is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> who initially studied and directed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and cites such European directors as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Stein Giorgio Strehler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariane Mnouchkine</ENAMEX> as influences tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor whether the text demands it or not And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> considered the father of Soviet socialist realism did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Summerfolk</ENAMEX> penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chekhov</ENAMEX> s Cherry Orchard is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances Wisely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> has kept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> s time and place intact Despite the absence of samovars and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton with boaters and fishing poles aplenty But beyond this decorative nod to tradition <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> s naturalistic drama into something akin to well farce The director s attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them but they often literally stand on their heads Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sellars Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls sprawling them on staircases dangling them off tables even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring do There are moments in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Summerfolk</ENAMEX> when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house which looks like a parody of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> and is designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Petrovich</ENAMEX> spout philosophic bon mots with the self conscious rat a tat tat pacing of Laugh In Talk hurts from where it spurts one of them says The clash of ideologies survives this treatment but the nuance and richness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> s individual characters have vanished in the scuffle As for the humor that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> s text provides when repainted in such broad strokes particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble it looks and sounds forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> does better with music than with words when she wants as she so often does want to express herself through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> s helpless play Here she has the aid of her longtime associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Helpern</ENAMEX> whom she appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity</ENAMEX> s first ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new 60 000 sound system and recording studio For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky Mr Helpern</ENAMEX> provided an aural collage of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Debussy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rachmaninoff</ENAMEX> which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brecht</ENAMEX> and indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ezra Pound Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to make it new Indeed during a recent post production audience discussion the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play Somewhere Over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rainbow</ENAMEX> so that the song s original beauty comes through surmounting the cliche The danger that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation a vision so at odds with the playwright s that the two points of view nullify rather than illuminate each other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bogart</ENAMEX> s cast is part and parcel of the problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Shea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Orson</ENAMEX> never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish idealistic young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vass</ENAMEX> and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Lvovna Cynthia Strickland</ENAMEX> as the long suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner not the inspirational counterrevolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorky</ENAMEX> intended Better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janice Duclos</ENAMEX> in addition to possessing one of the evening s more impressive vocal instruments brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olga</ENAMEX> everybody s favorite mom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marni Rice</ENAMEX> plays the maid with so much edge as to steal her two scenes But it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity Rep</ENAMEX> newcomer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Fried Zamislov</ENAMEX> the paralegal who is the actor to watch whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor s wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Becca Lish</ENAMEX> by licking her bosom Ms de Vries writes frequently about theater
