A proposed conflict of interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high technology new ventures say financiers researchers and university administrators The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health care businesses or lose their government money Among other concerns the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years governmental fear of abuse has risen But the guidelines could make it impossible to commercialize research says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Smith</ENAMEX> associate provost and vice president for research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec 15 After that it will make a final decision on the policy The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithox Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salem Mass</ENAMEX> start up says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> a managing partner of TA Associates a venture capital firm With 2 3 million he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> The researchers who are being financed by the Lithox funds will receive a royalty or percentage of sales if their research yields a commercial product But because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> like many other universities shares its royalties with researchers it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Daly</ENAMEX> says The high tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect For instance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Bioventures Inc</ENAMEX> a venture capital concern last month invested 600 000 to launch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Worcester Mass</ENAMEX> concern that will produce pharmaceuticals Scientists Rima Kaddurah Daouk and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Schimmel</ENAMEX> conducted the initial research at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology</ENAMEX> While Ms Kaddurah Daouk left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> to head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira Prof Schimmel</ENAMEX> will continue to work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> serve on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira s</ENAMEX> board and own a small equity stake in the company The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira</ENAMEX> transaction is typical of the way venture capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research While universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gloria W Doubleday</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities But the new guidelines could prevent scientists like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prof Schimmel</ENAMEX> from being involved with start ups such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira</ENAMEX> venture capitalists point out And if that happens the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed they say The stakes in the controversy are large Last year venture capitalists spent an estimated 600 million to finance start up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Venture Capital Association</ENAMEX> a trade group Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties In many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Bock</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avalon Ventures La Jolla Calif</ENAMEX> Investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because we had exclusive rights to those technologies he adds But under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work Without the exclusivity most venture capitalists won t have the incentive to invest in such deals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bock</ENAMEX> says Last year for example <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avalon</ENAMEX> and others invested 14 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athena Neurosciences Inc South San Francisco Calif</ENAMEX> to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain But before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> published most of the details giving all of the company s potential competitors a chance to exploit it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bock</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it But says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bock</ENAMEX> It was a close call The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization and force small companies to waste scarce capital entrepreneurs say If start ups can t have early access to research being conducted at institutions we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Emyanitoff</ENAMEX> manager of business development at Applied biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge Mass</ENAMEX> concern Duplicating research is both costly and time consuming for a start up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Emyanitoff</ENAMEX> says For its part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> insists that its guidelines should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use Universities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katherine Bick</ENAMEX> who oversees the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> grants program as its deputy director for extramural research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures Not long ago scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock Many officials are also concerned about companies getting a free ride on government sponsored research A congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research Among other provisions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Bick</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> administrator says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be ideas for discussion The predictions of doom are premature she says But when agencies like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> circulate guidelines they ve often already formulated policy veteran scientists say Indeed institutions already are taking note On Sept 14 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> began circulating a conflict of interest policy statement that in effect would follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> guidelines faithfully The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business In many other institutions scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> policy is settled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Says Mr Daly</ENAMEX> the venture capitalist It doesn t matter whether they call it guidelines or policy The damage is already done
