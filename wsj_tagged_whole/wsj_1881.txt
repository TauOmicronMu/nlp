With airline deals in a tailspin legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> trader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Steinhardt</ENAMEX> could have trouble parachuting out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair Group</ENAMEX> traders say Only a week ago when airline buy out fever was already winding down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> was engaged in a duel with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> He was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated 167 million to build an 8 4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stake for his investment clients The would be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> or for his own stake In fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> was pitted against another investor billionnaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX> who bought into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> to help fend off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt Mr Buffett</ENAMEX> s firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkshire Hathaway</ENAMEX> holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> s firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> Partners Now in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> s troubles in financing its buy out the airline raiding game has been grounded Instead of hoping to sell his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stake at analysts estimated buy out price of 80 a share <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> is stuck with roughly 3 7 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> shares that cost him 45 on average but yesterday closed at 40 1 2 up 1 4 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading It doesn t make sense to parachute out at this price <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> managers operating skills At the current price the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> holding represents 9 of all the assets that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> manages A week ago <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say they were skeptical If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 the market was saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> s presence wasn t worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover speculator Traders say this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions In trying to raid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into snags Moreover unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Buffett</ENAMEX> who often holds big stakes in companies for years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> hasn t in the past done much long term investing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> who runs about 1 7 billion for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steinhardt Partners</ENAMEX> made his name as a gunslinging trader moving in and out of stocks with agility enriching himself and his investment clients Meanwhile his big losses for instance in 1987 s crash generally have been trading losses So some see a special irony in the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> the trader now is encumbered with a massive illiquid airline holding Analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stock might lose four or five points if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> stake was dumped all at once As a result <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> must reconcile himself to selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> at a loss or to holding the shares as an old fashioned investment Long term investing that s not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> s style chuckles an investor who once worked at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> Partners He doesn t usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole adds another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> Partners alumnus In recent days traders say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> shares though the carrier won t discuss its buy back program If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> to get out says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Pettee</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> analyst But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> might not want to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> he adds In 1987 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair Chairman Edwin Colodny</ENAMEX> stonewalled when Trans World Airlines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman Carl Icahn</ENAMEX> threatened to take over the carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Icahn</ENAMEX> a much more practiced raider than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> eventually sold a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stake at a tiny profit through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bear Stearns Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> also could take that route He confers big trading commissions on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> firms However with airline stocks cratering he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say Especially galling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> say people close to him is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Colodny</ENAMEX> won t even take his telephone calls While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> isn t considered absolutely takeover proof its defenses including the sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> of a 12 stake in the company to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Buffett</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkshire Hathaway</ENAMEX> are pretty strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> s deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Buffett</ENAMEX> wasn t exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says Since last April the investor has made seven so called 13D filings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> as he bought and sold the company s stock Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company s managers and to stir interest in the stock But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> Partners to take over a company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Buffett</ENAMEX> won t talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> at all Analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> has great promise By the second half of 1990 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stock could hit 60 says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helane Becker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> She thinks traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35 But meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines which it acquired Moreover some investors think a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline stocks in coming months However <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says he s comfortable holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> as an investment While he has bought and sold some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he hasn t tried to unload his holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> adds that he bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX> stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group In 1989 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says he made money trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Air AMR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Overall</ENAMEX> his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20 he adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Does Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> regret his incursion into the takeover threat game <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">People</ENAMEX> close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat I don t think you ll find I m making a radical change in my traditional investment style <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Steinhardt</ENAMEX> says
