It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> let alone within the same party <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> trekked over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Democrat Rep Henry Gonzalez</ENAMEX> It was offered as an expression of cooperation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> who is investigating the 2 5 billion failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln Savings Loan Association</ENAMEX> But instead of thanks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Cranston</ENAMEX> was treated with cool formality Every witness receives a formal subpoena <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Gonzalez</ENAMEX> told him <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seldom</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> hearings caused so much apprehension in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Sen Cranston</ENAMEX> and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> by their friend and political benefactor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating Jr</ENAMEX> principal stockholder of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> s parent company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental Corp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix Ariz</ENAMEX> At the first day of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> s hearings last week <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Seidman</ENAMEX> chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp</ENAMEX> the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts said the agency is investigating whether <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> made illegal political contributions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating</ENAMEX> arranged nearly 1 million in donations to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Cranston</ENAMEX> and his various political causes and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers Future witnesses include a former federal S L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to subvert the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating Unlike</ENAMEX> many lawmakers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman Gonzalez</ENAMEX> says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper When you reach a point where a policy making body is trying to shape administrative decisions then that s a no no in my book the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> lawmaker says And he has attached himself to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> story tenaciously Unless the questions are answered I will keep on going Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues even those of opposing political parties In the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Development Department</ENAMEX> scandal for example <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Thomas Lantos</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California Democrat</ENAMEX> who led the hearings tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> grants secured by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sen Alfonse D Amato</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Republican</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is a genuine maverick He comes from the same political line as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright Patman</ENAMEX> a bank baiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> populist who chaired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> until 1974 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open Early in his political career as a city councilman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX> he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced denouncing the closed door affair publicly as a bat roost meeting The immediate target of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Gonzalez</ENAMEX> s inquiry is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Wall</ENAMEX> chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX> As the principal regulator of the thrift industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> delayed seizing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln S L</ENAMEX> for more than two years after his staff told him that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Gonzalez</ENAMEX> seems primed to lash out at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> when hearings resume <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> with testimony by two federal regulators from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco William Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Patriarca Mr Wall</ENAMEX> relieved them of responsibility for supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> in 1988 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> last week to discuss their testimony in advance I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> I m not going to tolerate it he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> however is a self proclaimed child of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and former staff director of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> An inquiry into his handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln S L</ENAMEX> inevitably will drag in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Cranston</ENAMEX> and the four others <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sens Dennis Deconcini D Ariz John Mccain R Ariz John Glenn D Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Riegle D Mich</ENAMEX> They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln S L</ENAMEX> had dragged on for two years I m certain that in the course of the hearings the names of the senators will be brought out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> says This is raising eyebrows When I first got a glimpse at the witness list I couldn t believe that they were going to go ahead and do this says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Waldman</ENAMEX> director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Watch</ENAMEX> a consumer group There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators And a Democratic aide to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> member remarks I too am astounded by it because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position All the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating</ENAMEX> lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> thrift s parent is an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> chartered corporation with holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michigan Chairman Gonzalez</ENAMEX> expresses sympathy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Riegle</ENAMEX> his counterpart as chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> He s wise he s good and I know he s an honest man the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texan</ENAMEX> says But at the same time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> hasn t forgotten a confrontation over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Senate</ENAMEX> negotiations over S NN L bailout legislation during the summer The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sens Cranston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> s principal sponsor <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Republican Sen Jake Garn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> s job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln S L Most</ENAMEX> importantly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> traded away the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration s controversial plan to finance the bailout which was partly reinstated later At the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> said several senators told him that they could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garn</ENAMEX> s insistence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway under the guise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> investigation In a way that s what this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gonzalez</ENAMEX> concedes Even some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> members could suffer from the fallout <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating</ENAMEX> raised 20 000 for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Doug Barnard</ENAMEX> s 1986 re election campaign while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Democrat</ENAMEX> was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering He recently voted present when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating</ENAMEX> to testify then changed his vote to yes But the chairman s supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a 1 1 billion fraud suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Keating</ENAMEX> and others <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rep Jim Leach R Iowa</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln S L</ENAMEX> affair is the biggest bank heist in history and adds The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making A witness set to testify on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX> was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> laundered campaign contributions illegally But the witness <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">William Crawford California</ENAMEX> s chief state thrift regulator denies saying that I don t know whether it was done properly or not because I m not a lawyer he said in a telephone interview yesterday But he said he is prepared to testify that executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions The committee also has summoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wall</ENAMEX> s predecessor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Gray</ENAMEX> He has characterized the five senators roles as tantamount to an attempt to subvert the regulatory process and he isn t expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting So the senators must brace themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Cranston</ENAMEX> as he returned to the capital last week from a one day trip to inspect earthquake damage in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> sighed to an aide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Well</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>Keatingland</ENAMEX>
