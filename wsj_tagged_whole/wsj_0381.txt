<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Director Steve Kloves</ENAMEX> took a big gamble on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> s voice He d cast the actress not exactly known for her way with a song as the singing star of The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabulous Baker Boys</ENAMEX> and he wanted her to carry the tunes herself So the call went out for Sally <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> is what is known in the trade as a studio singer The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> based artist estimates that she s performed on 200 300 film scores among them The Abyss Ironweed and Klute Her voice is audible on the incidental music for the TV series The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wonder Years Miami Vice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matlock</ENAMEX> She has also worked frequently as a lyricist and as a vocal contractor hiring and conducting choruses to sing movie title tracks Most of what I do is very anonymous But I was not brave enough to say I was willing to starve to death to be a recording artist And doing studio work has been a wonderful way to make a living for a long long time said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> who for five years in a row received the Most Valuable Player award as a female studio vocalist from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Recording Arts</ENAMEX> and Sciences the organization that hands out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grammys Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> s involvement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker Boys</ENAMEX> was the result of a long affiliation with the movie s composer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Grusin</ENAMEX> I had written lyrics with him and had sung for him in various films and contracted voices for him she said He knew my work and he called It was really funny When you approach a singer and tell her you don t want her to sing you always run the risk of offending He said I don t know if this is going to be a compliment or an insult but Then he explained that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> was going to do this film and the role she was playing was that of a singer and they wanted very much for her to do her own singing if that was possible At that point nobody including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> herself was certain it would be possible She had after all sung in only one movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grease II</ENAMEX> and the vocal demands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker Boys</ENAMEX> singing standards with only a piano backup were considerably more imposing and exposing than belting out a rock n roll score in concert with several other singers and instruments If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> wasn t sure she was up to putting over numbers like The Look of Love Ten Cents a Dance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">My Funny Valentine Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> wasn t sure she was up to showing the way I had not done any coaching before she said I have produced vocal performances in the studio for professional singers But I had never taken anyone from scratch before I had to go a lot by instinct I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> thought that in my career I had done what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie Diamond</ENAMEX> character had done and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> consciously or unconsciously would pick up some things One of the first lessons took place at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinegrill</ENAMEX> a lounge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> to hear a nightclub singer and soak up some atmosphere Her instincts were wonderfully astute remembered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> who is in her 40s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> sensed an undercurrent of anger in the singer s performance I think it s true with a lot of club singers who haven t had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Accordingly Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> incorporated anger into the development of her character As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> s vocal development For five or six weeks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> made daily two hour visits to the actress s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> home armed with sheet music and on occasion albums by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June Christy Blossom Dearie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ella Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> artists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> hadn t paid much mind to in the past I suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ella</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens Nobody</ENAMEX> sings better not that I wanted her to sound like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ella</ENAMEX> but there s a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX> might have listened to From the way she sang in those early sessions it seemed clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> had been listening not to Ella but to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dylan</ENAMEX> There was a pronunciation and approach that seemed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> influenced recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens Vowels</ENAMEX> were swallowed word endings were given short or no shrift When we worked it almost became a joke with us that I was constantly reminding her to say the consonants as well as the vowels To explain exactly what she meant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Grusin</ENAMEX> went into a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> studio and recorded a vocal demo of the songs being considered for inclusion in the movie so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> could learn the numbers correct enunciation and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Grusin</ENAMEX> also made a demo tape with just piano to provide accompaniment when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> practiced What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> had going for her besides determination <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> recalled that the actress was up one night until 3 a m practicing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">My Funny Valentine</ENAMEX> was an airy alto a nice breathy quality and intelligence When we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> said I couldn t talk with her as I would with someone who had a lot of vocal training So what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth She urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> to get the feeling of a smile in her throat and to put a smile on her face to give the pitch and the sound a lift She kept harping on the importance of overdoing the consonants and percussive endings like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> She talked about using language as a tool about flirting with the lyrics And please <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> when you sing the line in Makin Whoopee about another sunny funny honeymoon don t say funn ih the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dylan</ENAMEX> would Say funn eeee Put the clean vowel ending on it And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> must you continue to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day It was a process of discovery said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> who admitted she sometimes felt a bit like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Higgins</ENAMEX> What I tried to do was take the sparks of the positive stuff and fan them I tried not to do much don t do this don t do that There was another layer to the coaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helping Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> sing a song the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie Diamond</ENAMEX> would sing it Not brilliantly because after all this was a performer who was collecting paychecks from lounges at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiltons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Inns</ENAMEX> but creditably and with the air of someone for whom Ten Cents a Dance was more than a bit autobiographical It was an exercise of blending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> s singing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX> s singing explained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dangerous Liaisons</ENAMEX> had been a musical she would have had to give a different vocal performance because she was a different character in that movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> s vocal performance in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker Boys</ENAMEX> recorded for posterity on the soundtrack album <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GRP</ENAMEX> is such that after her first number More Than You Know viewers begin murmuring to each other Is that really her singing That isn t really her I can swear that every single note in that movie was hers averred <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Stevens</ENAMEX> who had begun kidding her protege that she was going to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonight Show</ENAMEX> booking Seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> up there she added was like watching myself or my daughter I was so nervous I wanted her to be so good I didn t want to feel as if I d let her down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Kaufman</ENAMEX> is a free lance writer based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX
