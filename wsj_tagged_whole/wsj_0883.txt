A simmering feud between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> government s two senior economic experts erupted with the abrupt resignation of Chancellor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exchequer Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> sending shock waves through an already shaken financial community and prompting an emergency cabinet shuffle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foreign Secretary John Major</ENAMEX> to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson Sir Geoffrey Howe</ENAMEX> deputy prime minister rushed out a statement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Commons that the government s economic and monetary policies would remain unchanged Meanwhile <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan Walters Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s controversial economic adviser and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s nemesis also announced his resignation The pound which has already slid about 10 against the West German mark in recent weeks plunged further on the news In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday sterling was quoted at 1 5765 down sharply from 1 6145 late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wednesday</ENAMEX> And brokers were bracing for a grueling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> in financial markets here You re going to get quite a major fall in the equity market and the gilt markets said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gwyn Hacche U K</ENAMEX> economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Capel Co Markets</ENAMEX> hate uncertainty Despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Howe</ENAMEX> statement the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> government s economic policy appeared to be in chaos One major question is just how the government will handle matters on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> differed explosively The two men clashed bitterly over the importance of exchange rates in setting monetary policy and the wisdom of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> fully joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX> which links together the major currencies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Though</ENAMEX> jolted by the surrounding confusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> emerged in undisputed command of her government s economic program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neil Kinnock Labor Party</ENAMEX> leader dubbed the 46 year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Major</ENAMEX> a lap dog unlikely to veer from his boss s strongly held views as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> sometimes did From the standpoint of the financial markets however the prime minister s positions seem murky in large part because she has presided over dueling advisers for the last six months I don t know where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> stands said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Horne</ENAMEX> an economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith Barney Harris Upham Co</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> She s played such a cat and mouse game with her advisers Although sometimes arcane economic debates undergirded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson Walters</ENAMEX> rift the 57 year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s surprise departure boiled down to a simple stand of he goes or I go In his letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> stated The successful conduct of economic policy is possible only if there is and is seen to be full agreement between the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer Recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement can not be satisfied so long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX> remains your personal economic adviser The upheaval leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> government isolated within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Six</ENAMEX> months ago the British prime minister s two senior cabinet members <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> chancellor since 1983 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Geoffrey</ENAMEX> then the foreign secretary both supported <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s early entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> out of the cabinet and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Geoffrey</ENAMEX> in the less influential job of deputy prime minister there s little to counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s innate suspicion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> s exchange rate mechanism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> brought back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Downing Street</ENAMEX> last spring as her adviser adamantly opposed it Indeed the final fracas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson Walters</ENAMEX> battle involved the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">EMS Sir Alan</ENAMEX> who also works in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington D C</ENAMEX> as a consultant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> and a fellow at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Enterprise Institute</ENAMEX> said in a article to be published in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> economic journal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> was half baked The scoff coming from the man many consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s most influential adviser sparked considerable worry It not only conflicted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s views but ran counter to the position <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> took at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madrid</ENAMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> There she said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> would join the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> had completely liberalized restrictions on capital movements and exchange controls and once <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> s inflation rate had fallen into line with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> Economists expect those conditions to be met in 1990 or 1991 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> stated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Commons debate this week that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> s views aren t the view of the government And in a subsequent television interview he said I think it is right that advisers do not talk or write in public Worn down by the feud he then made it clear to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> that he expected the controversial adviser to be ousted In remarks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Commons</ENAMEX> yesterday afternoon the prime minister disappointed him As she has done in the past she stated her support for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> but insisted on keeping on an adviser who opposed and disparaged his policies The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Major</ENAMEX> who served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> s deputy in 1987 aren t fully known Speaking in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of Commons last night he said of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> I was proud to serve in his team and proud that he has been and will remain a good friend To a great extent the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Downing Street</ENAMEX> blow up is the result of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s management approach <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fond</ENAMEX> of playing her senior advisers off against each other the prime minister has often allowed rivalries and animosities to bubble up within her cabinet Financial markets prefer a clear message from the government on its economic priorities and strategies Since the spring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> government has instead broadcast a cacophony <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Lawson</ENAMEX> carefully watched exchange rates and stood ready to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> interest rates when the pound slid too sharply against the dollar or the mark By contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> was viewed as a free floater or one who was inclined to let the currency markets set the level for the pound Last summer when the skirmishing became obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Horne</ENAMEX> said that the antipathies were adding confusion to an already murky situation in which sterling was becoming an increasingly volatile currency I question the strategy of having an alternate economic adviser he added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Thatcher</ENAMEX> s ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sir Alan</ENAMEX> were cemented during her first term when the straight talking economist served for three years as a key adviser According to a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Downing Street</ENAMEX> aide she would then say to him You get the economics right and I ll get the politics right <ENAMEX
