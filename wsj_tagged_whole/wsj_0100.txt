For six years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T Marshall Hahn Jr</ENAMEX> has made corporate acquisitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> mode kind and gentle The question now Can he act more like hard charging <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Roosevelt Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> the 62 year old chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia Pacific Corp</ENAMEX> is leading the forest product concern s unsolicited 3 19 billion bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Northern Nekoosa Corp Nekoosa</ENAMEX> has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> hasn t faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes So far <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> is trying to entice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies If a competitor enters the game for example <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> could face the dilemma of paying a premium for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival Given that choice associates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> and industry observers say the former university president who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything would fold There s a price above which I m positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> has the courage not to pay says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">A D Correll Georgia Pacific s</ENAMEX> executive vice president for pulp and paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Says</ENAMEX> long time associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Griffin</ENAMEX> vice president corporate development at WTD Industries <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX> He isn t of the old school of winning at any cost He also is a consensus manager insiders say The decision to make the bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> for example was made only after all six members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> s management committee signed onto the deal even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> knew he wanted to go after the company early on says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Correll</ENAMEX> Associates say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> picked up that careful approach to management as president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia Polytechnic Institute Assuming</ENAMEX> that post at the age of 35 he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren H Strother</ENAMEX> a university official who is researching a book on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand In 1970 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building That impressed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Robert B Pamplin Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> s chief executive at the time whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> had met while fundraising for the institute In 1975 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pamplin</ENAMEX> enticed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals the move befuddled many in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> who didn t believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> rose swiftly through the ranks demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on The son of a physicist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates Moving rapidly through school he graduated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phi Beta Kappa</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> at age 18 after spending only 2 1 2 years in college He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Technology Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> agrees that he has a retentive memory but friends say that s an understatement They call it photographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> also has engineered a surprising turnaround of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia Pacific Taking</ENAMEX> over as chief executive officer in 1983 he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession inspired slide in its building products business <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> began selling non core businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers At the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new home construction The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new home construction The formula has paid off so far <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> s sales climbed to 9 5 billion last year compared with 6 billion in 1983 when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> took the reins Profit from continuing operations has soared to 467 million from 75 million <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best The record of companies that have diversified isn t all that impressive he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nekoosa</ENAMEX> wouldn t be a diversification It would be a good match <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> and many analysts say of two healthy companies with high quality assets and strong cash flows The resulting company would be the largest forest products concern in the world with combined sales of more than 13 billion But can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hahn</ENAMEX> carry it off In this instance industry observers say he is entering uncharted waters Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn Mcauley</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">First Manhattan Co</ENAMEX> This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced
