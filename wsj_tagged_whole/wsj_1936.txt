This seems to be the season for revivals in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubs</ENAMEX> championship season ended with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League</ENAMEX> playoffs a revival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organic Theater</ENAMEX> s production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bleacher Bums</ENAMEX> a play in nine innings set in the Wrigley Field bleachers continues within spitting distance of the ballpark Revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship but both help explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> remains a vital center of this country s regional theater movement The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> is offering a modernized version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moliere</ENAMEX> s The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misanthrope</ENAMEX> through Nov 4 The original is a comedy about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alceste</ENAMEX> a man who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself He is the jealous friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philinte</ENAMEX> and the jealous lover of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> The play is filled with intrigue dishonesty and injustice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty</ENAMEX> five years ago the poet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wilbur</ENAMEX> modernized this 17th century comedy merely by avoiding the zounds sort of thing as he wrote in his introduction Otherwise the scene remained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> s house in 1666 Assuming modern audiences readily understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moliere</ENAMEX> s social indictment covers their world as well as 17th century <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris Mr Wilbur</ENAMEX> concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexandrine</ENAMEX> French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> translation is remarkable well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity But if you happen to be coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> in the next few weeks don t fail to have a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Falls</ENAMEX> s The Misanthrope at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wilbur</ENAMEX> s translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th century <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris Mr Falls</ENAMEX> s production is a mirror in which we see ourselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Falls</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> s artistic director took a recent adaptation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Bartlett</ENAMEX> and significantly adapted it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bartlett</ENAMEX> had slimmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moliere</ENAMEX> s cast of characters to six and set them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> media world of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thatcherite Britain Mr Falls</ENAMEX> transfers the setting to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there agents producers actors writers and sycophants It works <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bartlett</ENAMEX> managed to more or less maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moliere</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexandrine</ENAMEX> verse form 12 syllable lines in rhyming couplets <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Falls</ENAMEX> kept the form but Americanized it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bartlett</ENAMEX> s further help With a splendid cast led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Darlow</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alceste Christina Haag</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celimene</ENAMEX> and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brown</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philinte</ENAMEX> who plays the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> game but harbors authentic values and feelings the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> production barrels through an all night <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> party with exuberance and wit If this version with its references to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steven Spielberg Spago</ENAMEX> and thirtysomething attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messrs Bartlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> are justified in abandoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wilbur A</ENAMEX> 300 year old play may be easier to revive than one merely 25 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steppenwolf Theatre Company</ENAMEX> back from a critical and box office success in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> with its adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbeck</ENAMEX> s The Grapes of Wrath opened the new season with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Pinter</ENAMEX> s The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homecoming</ENAMEX> first produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Shakespeare Company</ENAMEX> in 1965 Back then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Pinter</ENAMEX> was not only the angry young British playwright but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue When The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homecoming</ENAMEX> was first produced on this side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> actors and directors were reverential Silences were lengthy nobody moved or gestured Nobody smiled onstage and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh This kind of theater was new to us Also it was not a funny time over here what with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> the 68 68 Democratic convention assassinations and riots But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Perry</ENAMEX> s direction the current <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> production scheduled to play through Nov 19 breaks through the flat and boring ritual that The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homecoming</ENAMEX> had become Led by a near perfect performance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Wilder</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> the father the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family s rage bitterness fear and isolation Encouraged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Wilder</ENAMEX> s sly grins embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act Three of the family members <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> and his two sons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey</ENAMEX> live off the flesh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> is a retired butcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX> a pimp and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey</ENAMEX> an aspiring boxer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Max</ENAMEX> s brother has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife Teddy the eldest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> s sons has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an American university Though it s clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> s wife who held sway here until her death now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> The play concerns Teddy s homecoming with his wife of six years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> Curiously <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Arney</ENAMEX> as Teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinter</ENAMEX> character As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Moira Harris</ENAMEX> a large and beautiful woman who may be our next <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colleen Dewhurst</ENAMEX> begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men In the end Teddy returns alone to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> s chair We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother and then some While <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> with The Grapes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wrath Bruce Sagan</ENAMEX> the president of its board of directors quietly returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> to buy a piece of real estate in the city s rapidly reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Halsted Street</ENAMEX> restaurant and theater district Within a year he hopes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> will move into a new 500 seat theater on that site The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one set production If we wanted to stage Death of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salesman Mr Sagan</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Loman</ENAMEX> would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> needs the extra seats even more than the fly space It s currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13 000 who can be accommodated in its present digs For all the attention that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> theater has received during the past decade not one new building has been devoted to it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sagan</ENAMEX> a former publisher and real estate developer has put together an 8 million financial package that includes approximately 4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater and approximately 1 million in grants from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Endowment</ENAMEX> for the Arts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macarthur Foundation</ENAMEX> and a few other deep pockets The rest he is confident can be raised His board members alone have pledged 800 000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sagan</ENAMEX> compares the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orson Welles</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury Theater</ENAMEX> in the 30s But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welles</ENAMEX> s theater company turned out to have a brief one might say a mercurial existence What will <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Sagan</ENAMEX> do with his new theater building if the allure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> proves too much for such <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> stalwarts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich Dangerous Liaisons Joan Allen</ENAMEX> The Heidi Chronicles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenne Headly Lonesome Dove</ENAMEX> and the company crumbles That s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">OK Mr Sagan</ENAMEX>
