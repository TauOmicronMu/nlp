necessary to eradicate the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> s unlawful employment practices <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Rubin</ENAMEX> a state judge since 1969 said the mandatory retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench The issue isn t age age is just a number The issue is one of a judge s experience his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Rubin</ENAMEX> said I ve had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Rubin</ENAMEX> turned 76 on May 9 he isn t eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year The suit s impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New

lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of U S attorneys <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Thornburgh</ENAMEX> will be free to disband the strike forces after <ENAMEX

temporarily halted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Thornburgh</ENAMEX> s effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan Opponents say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Thornburgh</ENAMEX> s plan will needlessly break up longtime tightly knit crime fighting units that have successfully prosecuted major organized crime figures They predict that organized crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to U S attorneys offices Some former strike force personnel say the units have already begun to break up The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern District</ENAMEX> unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn N Y</ENAMEX> lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura A Brevetti</ENAMEX> who left the strike force to join <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison Cohen Singer Weinstein</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX

shortly says the senator s spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Runkel</ENAMEX> says he doubts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kennedy</ENAMEX> can muster enough congressional support to reorganize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> We will vigorously oppose the bill he says I don t think the reorganization is going to happen WHITMAN RANSOM recruits lawyers from disbanding firm The
