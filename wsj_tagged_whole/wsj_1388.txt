When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mcduffie</ENAMEX> was 14 he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macon Ga Unfortunately</ENAMEX> his mother had tickets for a recital by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itzhak Perlman</ENAMEX> the same night and she was adamant about his attending I threw such a fit says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> who had begun violin studies at the age of six But once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> started playing I didn t give a damn about basketball Afterwards I went home and practiced for three hours Today it s obvious that the brawny six foot one inch musician made the right choice At 31 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> has a rich full bodied tone an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule He s currently in the midst of a 17 city U S tour with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yehudi Menuhin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw Sinfonia</ENAMEX> with stops including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston S C Oct</ENAMEX> 25 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sarasota Fla Oct</ENAMEX> 28 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa Fla Oct</ENAMEX> 29 and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami Oct</ENAMEX> 31 Later this season he gives a recital at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX> and appears as soloist with several major orchestras Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> s career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries During the late 1970s he was part of a musical brat pack a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juilliard School</ENAMEX> with the noted pedagogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Delay</ENAMEX> His violin classmates included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shlomo Mintz</ENAMEX> a protege of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern</ENAMEX> who performed with major orchestras while still a student <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cho Liang Lin</ENAMEX> who joined the roster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM Artists Inc</ENAMEX> at the age of 18 and Nadja Salerno Sonnenberg who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition I thought I was over the hill at 22 recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl But I wasn t ready for a career at that time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Mcduffie</ENAMEX> s first violin teacher was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henrik Schwarzenberger</ENAMEX> a Hungarian refugee who taught in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macon</ENAMEX> public school system He taught me how to play like a gypsy jokes the musician I didn t learn to count until I got to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juilliard</ENAMEX> After studies at that conservatory s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pre College Division</ENAMEX> with an assistant to the legendary instructor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Galamian</ENAMEX> he switched at the college level to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Delay Mr Galamian</ENAMEX> s longtime assistant and ultimately his rival I think I had to prove myself to her says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> But she was always encouraging She only put her foot down twice he continues In my freshman year my roommate was known as a party animal She thought I wasn t getting my practicing done As the violinist tells it his grandmotherly looking teacher put her hands on her hips stomped her foot and said You ve just got to get the expletive deleted out of there The second incident took place after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Delay</ENAMEX> requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital We listened to the Chausson Poeme he recalls and she said You hear the first note that B flat That s the only note that s truly in tune That s the most important experience I ve had with any teacher he says because she taught me how to listen Now when I play with orchestras the musicians often compliment me on my intonation It was also at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juilliard</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> discovered his predilection for conservative 20th century American composers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Diamond</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Barber</ENAMEX> After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Concerto Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> was invited to play the work for the composer who was dying of cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> was seated by the fireplace looking very pale recalls the violinist who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer s apartment He didn t say much but what he said was important because it s not in the score There s a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coplandesque</ENAMEX> motif he d kill me if he heard me say that throughout the first movement The only time the violin has it is right at the end It s written marcato in the score and I played it that way kind of gigue like And he yelled out dolce dolce sweet sweet So we did it over he adds I played very transparently with the tip of the bow If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra volume at that point it makes the piece magical I don t know why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> never told anybody else On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern</ENAMEX> s recording it s very biting Since leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juilliard Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> has made some smart moves and some controversial ones His guest appearance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> soap opera Another World scandalized musical elitists By contrast he s won kudos for his espousal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Schuman</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> which he recently recorded for Angel along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bernstein</ENAMEX> s engaging Serenade for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Solo Strings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percussion Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> s sweet tone heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works Aided by the fluid playing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St Louis Symphony</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Slatkin</ENAMEX> s direction this Serenade really swings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Schuman</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment meanders until the propulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agitato</ENAMEX> fervente But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist brass and timpani At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avery Fisher Hall</ENAMEX> here <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> was heard recently with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Menuhin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw Sinfonia</ENAMEX> in more conventional fare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruch</ENAMEX> s overwrought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> in G Minor His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed The 35 member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big lush sound that belied its size Whatever he plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Mcduffie</ENAMEX> finds satisfaction in the music itself something greater out there than me as he puts it during an interview at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> apartment he shares with wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camille</ENAMEX> a literary publicist A normal person did not write the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beethoven Violin Concerto</ENAMEX> he declares Even when I hear it played badly I m still humbled by the piece If I could ever feel I ve contributed to it in some way then all the hard work has been worth it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ms Jepson</ENAMEX> is a free lance music writer in New
