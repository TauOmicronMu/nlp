It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> s first visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> But the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> president s sixth visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sino U S</ENAMEX> relationship <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> the most prominent American to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> s bloody suppression of pro democracy demonstrators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> harped on international outrage over the massacre The Chinese in turn took aim at American interference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s domestic affairs One official newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Daily</ENAMEX> even directly criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> who is normally referred to here as an old friend The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of peaceful evolution a catch phrase to describe what <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere The tension was evident on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wednesday</ENAMEX> evening during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> s final banquet toast normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship Instead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> reminded his host <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chinese President Yang Shangkun</ENAMEX> that Americans haven t forgiven <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s leaders for the military assault of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> 3 4 that killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators Many in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> States including many friends of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Yang</ENAMEX> who was directly involved in ordering the attack The events of April through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX> responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion In talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon Chinese</ENAMEX> leaders expressed no regret for the killings and even suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring In a meeting Tuesday supreme leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon Frankly</ENAMEX> speaking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> not long ago <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> for it Despite the harsh exchanges the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations which have deteriorated into what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> referred to as the greatest crisis in Chinese American relations since his initial visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> 17 years ago In his return toast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon Mr Yang</ENAMEX> said the relationship had reached a stalemate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Relations</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> have been tense since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> 7 when Chinese dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fang Lizhi</ENAMEX> and his wife <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Shuxian</ENAMEX> took refuge in the U S Embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing Shortly</ENAMEX> afterwards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> imposed a series of anti <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> sanctions including suspension of most high level talks which could be codified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> congressional legislation in the coming weeks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> is traveling in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> as a private citizen but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> and his national security adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX> before coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturday</ENAMEX> And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> was to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> today According to an American member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> party the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top level Chinese officials These included <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s economic policies human rights and the question of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Fang Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> also proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> restore its participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fulbright Program</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> government funded academic exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> pulled out of the program in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> In his talks the former president urged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas Ideas are going over borders and there s no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDI</ENAMEX> ideological weapon that can shoot them down he told a group of Americans at the U S Embassy on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wednesday</ENAMEX> There are no signs however of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> s yielding on key issues But in one minor matter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> appears to have gained a concession In a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Premier Li Peng</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monday Mr Nixon</ENAMEX> said that he hoped he wouldn t encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U S Embassy Sure enough when he arrived at the embassy two days later the machine gun toting guards were gone for the first time in five months A few blocks away at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> ambassador s residence the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi model arms for the first time since early <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> But the guards there retained their pistols and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars Moreover police and soldiers continue to harass Americans who have filed several protests with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> in the past week Several times Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> diplomats and clicked the trigger The rifles weren t loaded
