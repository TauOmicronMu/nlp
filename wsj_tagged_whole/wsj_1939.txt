Within minutes after the stock market closed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> I called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> advised him that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Industrial Average</ENAMEX> had declined by 190 points late that afternoon and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow Democrats were to blame They had dealt a major setback that afternoon to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> s capital gains tax cut proposal which had seemed in the bag after it passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> overwhelmingly earlier in the month <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Bradley</ENAMEX> has it in his mind that such a tax cut would unravel the tax reform he helped engineer in 1986 But he knows that as many as 20 of his fellow Democrats are disposed to vote for the cut popular among their constituents As a result he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds He helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Majority Leader George Mitchell</ENAMEX> on these grounds The budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the Oct 15 deadline and these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to append capital gains to the budget bill knowing it would pass Denied a vote on substance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> leadership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> morning was confronted with a hard choice It could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month or it could follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> strategy to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended The U S Chamber of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> has been in the forefront in supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> proposal It endorsed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> strategy believing it to be the surest way to victory At noon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> official advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rahn</ENAMEX> the Chamber s chief economist that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Two hours later the first word emerged on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rahn</ENAMEX> was shocked telephoning the office of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> and the administration s chief strategist on this issue He left a message accusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Darman</ENAMEX> of selling out It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Republicans though who had edged away from the veto strategy The stock market reacted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rahn</ENAMEX> did crumbling as it absorbed the news that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Darman</ENAMEX> s strategy had been abandoned The stock market after all represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation s capital stock discounted to present value Why should it be so surprising that a 30 cut in the capital gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation s capital stock The total value of privately held assets is easily more than 15 trillion The value traded on the exchanges is close to 3 trillion If the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled wouldn t the value fall to the owners of the assets Isn t it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it you would be able to keep 30 more of its gain than you previously believed Indeed the stock market s steady advance this year tracked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> s success in advancing his capital gains proposal A 30 cut in this year s capital gains alone amounts to roughly 50 billion We re talking real money When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rahn</ENAMEX> advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed Instead the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> Airlines instantly knocked 7 off the value of the nation s capital stock and caused convulsions around the world <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Rahn</ENAMEX> was pointing out an elephant rumbling through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> while conventional wisdom had fastened on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> flea Why is this happening For one thing quite a number of the leading spokesmen on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> are not portfolio managers who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets They are economists and financial reporters who sympathize with the view that a capital gains tax cut benefits the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yet</ENAMEX> they somehow think that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> morning and is now problematic The market rebound Monday followed weekend assurances from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Darman</ENAMEX> that the administration has other plans to win the cut which is alive and well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Bradley</ENAMEX> s argument is that a capital gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income tax rates in 1990 he thinks when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets That is with capital gains cut the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone and political realities will push up income tax rates The counter argument which he has heard is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president s proposal the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy In this atmosphere there would be no serious consideration of tax increases If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Bradley</ENAMEX> would permit a vote on capital gains though it would pass Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market the 1990 economy would be robust and the revenue gains at every level of government including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> s would be surprisingly high No tax increases would be necessary The struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street Mr Wanniski</ENAMEX> is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polyconomics Inc</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morristown N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE='untagged'>J</ENAMEX>
