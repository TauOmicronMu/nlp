TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp</ENAMEX> slash tags to spur sales Concerns about the stock market doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Abramson</ENAMEX> president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX
