The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> still stands But the man who built it has fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> yesterday removed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker</ENAMEX> one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX> world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens But while it was a move that stunned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> bloc it hardly ushers in an era of reform at least anytime soon For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> who had led <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus with a man cut of the same cloth <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz</ENAMEX> the most recent internal security chief and a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> protege <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> it is clear is no <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> now shares power with the democratically elected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> union Nor is it a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX> nation into a multiparty democracy Still any change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> has enormous implications for both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> It raises the long cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> 52 was named the new party chief just minutes after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> s 163 member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> convened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX> Although the East German news agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADN</ENAMEX> claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> had asked to be relieved of his duties for health reasons West German government sources said the 26 man <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuesday Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADN</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> a hard line <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalinist</ENAMEX> who in 1961 supervised the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlin Wall</ENAMEX> also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation s parliament convenes later this week <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> s ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron handed leadership during which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> now 77 years old built <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule fled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> s largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers uprising in 1953 In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change The official line was to offer warmer ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> provided he is willing to institute reforms But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> told reporters Whether that the leadership change reflects a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East West</ENAMEX> relations I don t think so Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> has been very much in accord with the policies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker One</ENAMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> expert on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> added There is no clear cut champion of reform that we know of in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> German leadership Indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro democracy groups He said while dialogue is important enough forums already exist in which different interests can express themselves The removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX> party According to West German government sources <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> and several senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change But with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say Those allies included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> members <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guenter Mittag</ENAMEX> who has long headed economic affairs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim Hermann</ENAMEX> chief of information policy Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday Although other resignations may follow it s still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government s resistance to fundamental change Clearly the central figure in this process is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egon Krenz Born</ENAMEX> in 1937 in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX> town now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> he was eight years old when World War II ended Like West German <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chancellor Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> s division Since joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> in 1983 as its youngest member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> had acquired the nickname crown prince a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand picked successor to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> In fact the two men have had strikingly similar career paths both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position Moreover both men have hewn to a similar hard line philosophy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notably</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> s few official visits overseas came a few months ago when he visited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> after the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> He later defended the Chinese government s response during a separate visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany East</ENAMEX> German Protestantism in particular fears <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> in part because of an incident in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church However <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> also has a reputation for being politically savvy His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> Indeed according to West German government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> In recent days <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> has sought to project a kinder image According to a report widely circulating in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX> it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leipzig</ENAMEX> He doesn t want to have the image of the gun man says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Oldenburg</ENAMEX> an expert at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> Studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cologne</ENAMEX> He s not a reformer he wants to have the image of a reformer As part of his image polishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party s authority Besides sacking other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> officials who allied themselves with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> could loosen controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups But will it be enough West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful He doesn t signify what people want so the unrest will go on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Oldenburg</ENAMEX> predicts At the same time the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Says</ENAMEX> one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> German official What s necessary now is the process of democratization Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chancellor Kohl</ENAMEX> meanwhile has invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> to open discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> on a wide range of subjects Reports in the West German press citing sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> may serve only as a bridge between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> and a genuine reform leader Adding to that speculation is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> s reputation as a heavy drinker who is said to also suffer from diabetes This is a dynamic process and we re experiencing the first step the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> official adds The selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> may also disappoint <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has pressed hard for a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> s rigid stance Two reform minded party leaders favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> as possible successors to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker Dresden</ENAMEX> party secretary Hans <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guenter Schabowski</ENAMEX> were passed over If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> could intensify In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moscow Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change According to the Soviet news agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tass Gorbachev</ENAMEX> expressed the conviction that the leadership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Unity Party</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDR German Democratic Republic</ENAMEX> encountered A force of younger pro <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they didn t From the perspective of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> s old guard reforms that smack of capitalism and Western style democracy could eliminate their country s reason for being Unlike the other nations of the bloc <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> is a creature of the Cold War Erasing the differences still dividing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the vast international reordering that implies won t endanger the statehood of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> or a Hungary But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> from the map Which is what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Guard</ENAMEX> fears I m sure they ll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDR</ENAMEX> s future as a separately identifiable state says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Simmons</ENAMEX> a British journalist whose book on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> entitled The Unloved Country was published this month Up to now that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Ulbricht</ENAMEX> to establish the country s international legitimacy followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> s campaign to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> bloc s only successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalinist</ENAMEX> economy into a consumer paradise Neither man achieved perfection Early in 1987 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> and his team stopped paying thin compliments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> and joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romania</ENAMEX> in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems The less self confident <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovaks</ENAMEX> and Bulgarians in contrast declared their intentions to reform while doing nothing concrete about it The East German media soon began presenting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev</ENAMEX> s speeches only as sketchy summaries and giving space to his opponents By late 1988 they were banning Soviet publications The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> spoke of generally valid objective laws of socialism and left no room for debate With this year s dislocations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and the drive to democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> German leadership grew still more defensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim Herrman</ENAMEX> confessed to a grave concern over Hungarian democracy Under the banner that proclaims the renewal of socialism he said forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism Some loyal voices in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German Communist</ENAMEX> party saw the nation s unrest coming The first signs were economic Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> Germans have for years watched the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> pull farther out ahead In 1988 for the first time economic growth came to a dead stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gingerly</ENAMEX> some economists began to blame central planning Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy at least in the workplace By summer an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before But they are stalwart socialists Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalinist</ENAMEX> muck not to merge with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> One of their pastors has envisioned a new utopia of creative socialism Meanwhile the man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Krenz</ENAMEX> replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society Imprisoned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nazis</ENAMEX> during World War II for his political beliefs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> who took their cues from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> He was a socialist warrior who felt rankled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> s enormous postwar prosperity and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> government s steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state Finally during his first and only state visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> two years ago he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gorbachev Mr Honecker</ENAMEX> s removal was bound to happen says one aide to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chancellor Kohl</ENAMEX> It was only a matter of time The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> increased its forecast for economic growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> in 1989 to 3 5 slightly higher than its
