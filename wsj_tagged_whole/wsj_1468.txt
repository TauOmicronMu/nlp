<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ekco Group Inc Nashua N H</ENAMEX> expects to report that net income in the third quarter ended Oct 1 fell 50 to 60 from 2 1 million or 11 cents a share a year earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stein</ENAMEX> president and chief executive officer attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two week strike last month at the company s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Masillon Ohio</ENAMEX> bakeware facility Softer than expected orders in early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> also played a role he said in an interview But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said he is reasonably confident that earnings for the full year will exceed the 3 1 million or 17 cents a share in 1988 That would require fourth quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share assuming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> s third quarter estimate proves accurate In the year earlier fourth quarter the company had profit of 2 7 million or 15 cents a share Third quarter revenue is expected to be 40 million to 45 million up from 38 2 million a year earlier according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Gordon</ENAMEX> treasurer The year earlier periods don t reflect results of the company s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodstream Corp</ENAMEX> unit acquired last <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> through October traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said some retailers perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories appear to have held back on orders in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">September</ENAMEX> but have been ordering more heavily in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">October Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodstream</ENAMEX> is marginally profitable but hasn t performed as well as expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodstream</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor</ENAMEX> brand mousetraps and other pest control products are doing very well and its plastic storage case products are poised for growth he said But the unit s third segment wildlife traps is suffering from a depressed market and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> is seeking to sell that segment he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco Housewares</ENAMEX> in late 1987 Prior to acquiring the housewares business the company was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centronics Corp Centronics</ENAMEX> had been a maker of computer printers but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said tighter operating controls have enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> to reduce inventory levels 25 to 30 improve on time delivery of orders to about 95 from around 70 and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit By moving the design of new products in house instead of contracting out the work the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently he said In addition to those measures the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers retail outlets a strategy that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said has helped bolster awareness of the company s brands <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> s housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets as well as bakeware at factories in the U S and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> The main issue in the strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> facility was health care benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said The strike ended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oct Ekco</ENAMEX> continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer products industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Stein</ENAMEX> said He indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of 75 million to 100 million partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger and fewer suppliers
