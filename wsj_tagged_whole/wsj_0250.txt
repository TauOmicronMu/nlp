Congressional Democrats and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration agreed on a compromise minimum wage bill opening the way for the first wage floor boost in more than nine years The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> over the wage issue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President Bush</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> vetoed a measure passed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and said he wouldn t accept any minimum wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year s debate on the issue The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> had said it would accept Under the agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders the minimum wage would rise from the current 3 35 an hour to 4 25 an hour by April 1991 Employers could also pay a subminimum training wage for 90 days to new workers who are up to 19 years old and then for another 90 days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> has fought for throughout the year For the first time in history we have a training wage that will be part of the nation s labor laws said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Porter</ENAMEX> assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage the final minimum wage increase will meet the standards set by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> The bill vetoed by the president in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> failed to override would have lifted the minimum wage to 4 55 an hour by late 1991 with a training wage for up to two months generally for a worker s first job <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Bush</ENAMEX> had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to 4 25 an hour by the end of 1991 coupled with a six month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer Under the compromise the 4 25 level would be reached nine months earlier while the training subminimum would be shorter unless it is tied to a training plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democrats</ENAMEX> argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their jobs Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately With congressional elections next year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> leaders have worried about opposing a minimum wage rise for low paid workers at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is moving toward a capital gains tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers Republicans have been imploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to compromise on the wage issue In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Edward Kennedy D Mass</ENAMEX> chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Committee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Domenici R N M</ENAMEX> ranking minority member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget Committee</ENAMEX> have been working on a compromise and their soundings showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> veto a Democratic staff official said The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise as a substitute to a new Democratic bill itself watered down from last spring s version The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> will probably vote not long afterward Some Democrats thought they might have compromised too much <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rep Austin Murphy D Pa</ENAMEX> chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> labor standards subcommittee said they might have done better if we d held their feet to the fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Kennedy</ENAMEX> suggested Democrats yielded a great deal on the size of the increase but he cited concessions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> on the training wage which he said make it less harsh With only 16 year olds to 19 year olds eligible 68 of workers getting less than 4 25 an hour who are adults won t be subject to the training wage he said The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL CIO</ENAMEX> which previously opposed the administration s subminimum idea said the compromise has adequate safeguards so the youth are not exploited and older workers are not displaced Gerald F Seib contributed to this article
