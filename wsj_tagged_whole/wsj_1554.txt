<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> s attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal Silver now trading around 5 an ounce surged to an all time peak of 50 an ounce in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX> 1980 from around 9 in mid 1979 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hunt</ENAMEX> s attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today s market depression says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesley Edgar</ENAMEX> managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sharps Pixley Ltd London</ENAMEX> bullion brokers While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Hunt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> associates aren t hanging over the market anymore the price surge of 1979 80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Edgar</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Photographic</ENAMEX> developers for example bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs negatives and processing solutions Meanwhile the photographic industry which accounts for 44 of silver consumption continues to look for substitutes Japanese and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X rays that don t require silver dealers say Silver s history of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers say Even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are preferring quality assets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum dealers say Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers say Silver however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid 1970s Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick R Demler</ENAMEX> analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc A</ENAMEX> further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> he says Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union Silver</ENAMEX> prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico Mr Demler</ENAMEX> says Meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row he says Japanese demand grew by 70 in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4 5 million ounces Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Demler</ENAMEX> says Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years improvements in the supply demand balance haven t managed to push silver prices into a higher range There s just too much silver around says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Butler</ENAMEX> an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Montagu Co</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> bullion house A huge silver stockpile at exchanges refiners consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</ENAMEX> in a report This year alone inventories at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> jumped by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces because of producer deliveries de stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhona O Connell London</ENAMEX> based precious metals analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Silver</ENAMEX> production is also in an inexorable upward trend Ms O Connell says Moreover while Asian and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> investors hoard gold and help underpin its price silver doesn t have the same mystique dealers say Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urs Seiler</ENAMEX> senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland Yet</ENAMEX> if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he says However dealers caution that any increase would be 1 to 2 at most Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Livestock</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meats</ENAMEX> Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer than expected cattle on feedlots After the close of trading <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8 06 million cattle on Oct 1 down 6 from that date a year earlier Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 decline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feedlots</ENAMEX> fatten young cattle for slaughter so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 compared with the year earlier quarter Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 decline in placements for the quarter In the 1988 quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 from the 1988 quarter which was in line with projections by analysts <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Energy Friday</ENAMEX> s 44 cent a barrel price drop to 19 98 in the expiring November contract for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract s going off the board Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that s been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions Barring any petroleum related news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth quarter demand will keep prices firm Copper Copper prices fell sharply <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> afternoon For example copper for December delivery settled 4 5 cents lower at 1 2345 a pound Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long term strikes On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> one analyst said rank and file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three month strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British Columbia</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> the analyst added employees at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cananea</ENAMEX> mine who have been out of work since late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a 35 cut in the 3 800 man work force The mine is expected to return to production in about a week On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Friday</ENAMEX> selling dominated the afternoon curb session in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> which takes place at noon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX> The premium of cash copper to the three month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long</ENAMEX> term support for the December contract was believed to be at 1 25 a pound A technical analyst said there were a number of stop loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract s price fell below it That brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading In general it was a bearish close said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Hanauer</ENAMEX> a copper trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudolph Wolff Co</ENAMEX> a major commodities trading and brokerage firm But whether this price break has implications for this week he said we will know more when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> copper stock levels are released Monday morning Another analyst said he expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LME</ENAMEX> inventories to be down by about 15 000 tons when the weekly report is issued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Savaiko</ENAMEX> senior commodities analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc</ENAMEX> said that when traders saw the market wasn t reacting positively to the forecasts of lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LME</ENAMEX> stocks they perceived a bearish sign He also noted that the Japanese who had been buying at prices just above the 1 25 level apparently pulled back from the market on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friday Mr Savaiko</ENAMEX> said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to 1 05 a pound
