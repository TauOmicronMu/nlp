I approached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate Larry Gelbart</ENAMEX> s new comedy at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criterion Center</ENAMEX> with considerable trepidation Nothing I assumed would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran Contra</ENAMEX> affair I had underestimated however both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> s wit and the persistence of scandal in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> Though the play clearly is framed around the events of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran Contra</ENAMEX> it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years In fact at one point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merry Chase Melinda</ENAMEX> Mullins a cool carefully coiffed television announcer recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years concluding with those affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Development</ENAMEX> and the savings and loan industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onstage</ENAMEX> a congressional hearing is in progress complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> in the background The witness table is center stage and below it the paraphernalia for the ever present media in this case TNN the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Total News Network</ENAMEX> Not only are there camera operators on all sides but the proceedings are shown on monitors throughout the theater The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing the witnesses the lawyers the interrogators and the news media are performers As the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate</ENAMEX> unfolds we learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes The man it seems has a Lichtenstein corporation licensed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libya</ENAMEX> and sheltered in the Bahamas He himself lives in a consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> The property seized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> film studio <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Master Pictures Incorporated MPI</ENAMEX> Supposedly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> will sell off the assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MPI</ENAMEX> but before it can a lowly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> agent is called into the hospital room of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wylie Slaughter</ENAMEX> the dying head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> The lowly agent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abel Lamb</ENAMEX> who as you might guess is being led to the slaughter is ordered to take over the studio Soon the studio is producing a 40 million picture called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion Picture</ENAMEX> to distinguish it from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX> the Offensive as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX> the Book and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX> the Album The picture to be made in the Central American country of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Elvador</ENAMEX> is a cover for sending 800 million of arms to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Otros</ENAMEX> the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ambigua</ENAMEX> which has been taken over by the leftist dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Overtega</ENAMEX> a former podiatrist who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers The man handling all this for the now deceased Slaughter is Major <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manley Battle Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> s stand in for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Col Oliver North Director Michael Engler</ENAMEX> has assembled a top flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel von Bargen</ENAMEX> is ramrod stiff but totally assured as Major Battle mixing just the right brand of self righteousness and patriotism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Weiss</ENAMEX> is fire brimstone and teary eyed emotionalism as the far right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle Zach Grenier</ENAMEX> is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Daly</ENAMEX> has the perfect aw shucks demeanor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> in his portrayal of the vice president and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Mcdonough</ENAMEX> is first rate as a succession of witnesses wives With one she is pregnant with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag and as the vice president s wife she rushes in with white hair wearing a tailored suit and pearls imitating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bush</ENAMEX> s gestures down to the last detail Though it s clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> s sympathies do not lie with the far right it s also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> also has fun with language <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate</ENAMEX> is subtitled a play on words and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> plays that game as well as anyone He describes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate</ENAMEX> flunky as one who experienced a meteoric disappearance and found himself handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness however <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> deplores the obfuscation the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides As the hearings begin the self important <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen Bowman Jerome Kilty</ENAMEX> announces Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese Without further monetary stroke military aid scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle At another point he intones Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy The evening is short 95 minutes without an intermission but even so as the play progresses the thrust of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> s satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably Most of the evening though is filled with rare and welcome wit In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate Mr Gelbart</ENAMEX> has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> theater sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language
