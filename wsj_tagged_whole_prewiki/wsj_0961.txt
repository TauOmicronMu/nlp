<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> can wipe out inflation without causing a recession but he said doing so will inflict some short term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> said he and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> governors endorse a bill by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Stephen Neal D N C</ENAMEX> that would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years Such a deadline is attainable but it would have costs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Neal</ENAMEX> s monetary policy subcommittee The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chief opposed a bill introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reps Lee Hamilton D Ind</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Dorgan D N D</ENAMEX> that among other things would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> In responding to questions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> played down reports of tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> over exchange rate policy What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics he said He didn t elaborate But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> isn t enthusiastic about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign exchange markets and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> is frustrated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar s value <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> said the inflation rate currently about 4 1 2 could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output In other words economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> who has repeatedly said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s goal is to reduce inflation added that whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter He warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> efforts to conquer inflation would fail and could produce a major financial crunch unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit which causes the government to borrow heavily <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rep Neal</ENAMEX> s bill originally called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter He altered the wording to win <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> s endorsement Even so his bill is given little chance of passage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reps Hamilton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorgan</ENAMEX> also have altered their bill dropping a proposal to add the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary to the 12 member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> committee that makes monetary policy Instead the bill simply calls for twice a year meetings between the committee and top administration officials Even that met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> s disapproval because it might subject the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to a more intensely political perspective and could risk bending monetary policy away from long term strategic goals While each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton Dorgan</ENAMEX> proposals represents only a small step together they would erode the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> s independence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Greenspan</ENAMEX> also said that although he favors cutting capital gains taxes as sound economic policy he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Reform Act</ENAMEX> of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates
