Well the arrogant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> media have spoken again Going for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> editorial Oct 17 Having resided in the great state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> for the past seven years I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing Perhaps it s entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists suggesting that their save the earth initiatives are whacky and referring to so many citizens as la la activists Strange that we don t hear similar criticisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> activists who seek to clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston Harbor</ENAMEX> or rid their beaches of medical waste While there are no easy low cost solutions simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state the nation and the world If nothing else such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action Before your next <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> bashing editorial please spend more time out here witnessing the situation it just may change your view <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John Barry Ventura Calif</ENAMEX> I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> and its environmental movement but picking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> to say it for you was a bad call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> s organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among la la activists Indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature Obviously it s lost on you that about 75 of the American people these days and in fact the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> States consider themselves environmentalists As for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> being a state run by liberal environmental loonies let s not forget where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> came from Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Reagan</ENAMEX> who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> who said Is this not Anti Christ The Moloch that knows no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> but more <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Robert Borden Santa Monica Calif</ENAMEX> Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers comments in letters to the editor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alar Scaring</ENAMEX> on the Side of Caution The illogic and inaccuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H Adams</ENAMEX> s comments for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> Resources <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Council</ENAMEX> fully justifies your characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> s Greens in particular as la la activists We may all hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> s voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university s renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prof Tom Jukes</ENAMEX> provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> weepers I have a different approach to offer not only to Californians but to all Americans In a free country the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good manners and public safety Would be naysayers should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">W Brown Morton Jr Warsaw Va</ENAMEX> The 170 airlines in the <ENAMEX
