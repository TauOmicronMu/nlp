<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan Air Lines Lufthansa German</ENAMEX> Airlines and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> reportedly plan to form an international air freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry Japanese newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX> reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground cargo and air cargo systems They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen 140 million in the venture whose headquarters would be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> The action follows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express Corp</ENAMEX> s acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Tiger Line Inc</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX> After that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotton Daly</ENAMEX> director of cargo services for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> consulting firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simat Helliesen Eichner Inc Mr Daly</ENAMEX> said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express United Parcel Service</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America Inc</ENAMEX> and other fast growing air freight companies Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a tie between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European</ENAMEX> airlines In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> spokesman said he couldn t confirm or deny the latest Japanese report But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> is talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> about some sort of cargo venture It is just one of a number of strategies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> after 1992 the deadline for ending trade barriers in the <ENAMEX

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Lufthansa</ENAMEX> spokeswoman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> said the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> s cargo operations had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyko</ENAMEX> last week for talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris Air France</ENAMEX> declined to comment Nothing is defined or signed at this point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Daly</ENAMEX> said of the talks Whatever accord the three carriers reach he said he is skeptical it would create a separate airline If the three companies pool their air freight businesses their clout would be considerable According to figures from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Air Transport Association</ENAMEX> they carried a combined 1 8 million tons of freight last year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Tiger</ENAMEX> as separate companies carried a combined 2 6 million tons <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> last month concluded a far reaching cooperation accord that includes air freight activities They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground handling and create a world wide computer system to process cargo Other airlines would have access to the system they said and negotiations with partners were already under way <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Both European</ENAMEX> airlines operate extensive fleets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 freighters and 747 Combis aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck They currently have large orders for cargo planes Several airlines including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay Pacific Airways</ENAMEX> are working on a so called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mr Daly</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> before the end of 1992 Last month the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to other European destinations British Airways said it hasn t received a proposal from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> But last week there were air traffic negotiations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> a likely first step to any commercial agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> or another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U K</ENAMEX> carrier
